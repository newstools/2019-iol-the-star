“Having had a discussion with the officials of our glorious movement, we are happy that they are dealing with the matters relating to our president. We have decided not to continue with the media briefing, as posted earlier today,” Mthembu posted on Twitter. On Tuesday, ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe issued a statement saying the party had noted with “grave concern” leaked emails claiming to be giving details on Ramaphosa’s campaign for leadership at its 54th conference. He said the NEC meeting last month “reflected on the methodologies for campaigning as well as funding for such activities, and resolved to direct the national officials to look into how these processes may be better managed in the future”. “The ANC is not aware of any acts of illegality on the part of a campaign conducted by any leader of the ANC, including President Ramaphosa. “The leaked emails are nothing but a calculated manoeuvre to defocus and detract from the immediate task of socio-economic issues, and dealing with the challenges of our economy,” Mabe said. On Saturday the Presidency reiterated that there was nothing untoward about the way the CR17 campaign was run. "Neither the President nor the campaign has done anything wrong, ethically or legally. It is a common and accepted practice in South Africa and across the world for parties and candidates to raise funding from donors for campaigns. "From the outset, the CR17 campaign team and the candidate agreed that this should be a clean campaign that operated within the necessary legal prescripts and in line with the values and principles of their organisation."
