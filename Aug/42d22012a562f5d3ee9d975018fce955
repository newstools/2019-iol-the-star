She entered Miss SA in 2017 but only made it to the semi-finals. However, that did not stop her and today, she is reigning supreme.       When asked what has changed from the day she first entered the competition in 2017, she said: "I'm a different person now. Back then, I didn't know myself that much but now I came back stronger with a bigger purpose."
