Johannesburg - Greenpeace Africa blocked the entrance to Eskom's Megawatt Park in Sunninghill with hospital beds during their protest on Tuesday morning. The non-governmental environment organisation said their protest was against the power utility’s contribution to air pollution and high sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions in Mpumalanga. The protest comes shortly after a study carried out  by the organisation which listed Kriel, a town in Mpumalanga, as the world’s second biggest sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission hotspot. The report further stated that there are 12 power stations in Mpumalanga, making the province the largest sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission hotspot in the world from power generation. According to Greenpeace Africa's Melita Steel, the power utility’s coal fire stations in Mpumalanga are the biggest contributor to the pollution crisis. “We believe that people are paying the price for Eskom’s pollution with their health and in some cases with their lives,” she said. Speaking to Jacaranda News, Steele said the hospital beds placed at the entrance of the utility’s headquarters were meant to demonstrate the impact of pollution on ordinary people. “There are hospital beds and there are ‘patients’ in the beds to signify the people who are actually affected by the pollution and we want to bring that to the doorstep of Eskom,” she added. Steel also handed the report that claims to show that South Africa is one of the worst emitters of SO2 pollution in the world to Eskom's Andrew Etzinger. The Star
