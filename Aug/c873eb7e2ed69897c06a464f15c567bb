Johannesburg – After 50 years of living in the dark, Heaven Valley residents can see the light after City of Joburg electrified  the area, ending rampant and dangerous illegal connections. The City electrified the area on Tuesday, a few month after Mayor Herman Mashaba made the promise to the community. The residents said their lives have changed for the better because Mashaba kept his ‘short-term' promise and electrified their area after about 50 years living with no lights. With constructors still on site, community members whose homes were switched on said the electrification was one big thing that the government has done for them. Mariam Bondis, 73, said she has been staying in the area since it was established and she still stays in one of the first asbestos structures that were erected when the area established. “I am very happy that I have electricity in my home. It has been so long living without power. I was depending on candles and paraffin,” she added. According to Evelyn Louw the area was infested by illegal electricity connection which she said were endangering the lives of residents, especially children. She added that it was a good thing that the government heard their grievances and acted in such speed to attend to them. The Star
