Free State - Police have promised a R500 000 reward for anyone with information that will help solve the murders of a mother and his son who where killed in their Thaba Nchu home in March. On March 25 , 54-year-old Lesang Motladile was cooking when two unknown men stormed her house with rifles and started shooting randomly, leaving her with gunshot wounds on her stomach and arms. Matladile’s 27-year-old son, Bongani, rushed from his bedroom to the kitchen to investigate only to be shot several times by the gunmen who then fled the scene. The only survivor in the house was Motladile's six year old son who took cover under the table as his mother was being shot. He escaped unharmed. According to Sergeant Martin Xuma, a neighbour who heard the gunshots called the police. “Two counts of murder were opened for investigation after emergency medical services declared both victims dead,” said Xuma. Xuma said police made no arrests since the incident and a reward of R50 000 has now made available for anyone with positive information that could lead to the arrest and successful conviction. Information may be communicated to Detective Constable Keabetswe Mogoera on 082 467 6612 or 051 875 1109. The Star
