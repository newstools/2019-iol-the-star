Johannesburg - Three members of the Satanic cult that claimed 11 lives in Krugersdorp will spend the rest of their lives in prison after they were slapped with life sentences each. Cecilia Steyn, Zak Valentine and Marcel Steyn were handed a number of life sentences for killing people between 2012 and 2016 when they were part of a cult dubbed "Electus Per Deus" (Chosen by God). Steyn received 13 life sentences while Valentine got eight. Marcel, who is only 21-years-old, is believed to have been 14 when she and her accomplices went on their deadly spree in the West Rand town. However, she received seven life terms for the brutal murders of her victims. Handing down judgment, Judge Jacob Francis Marcel  said all the victims were innocent and did not deserve to die in the manner they did. "All suspects showed no or little remorse for commission of their crimes and courts are expected to send a clear messages to the community and by so sentences handed out should deter others from committing crimes of the same nature," he said.
