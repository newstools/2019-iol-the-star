Johannesburg - Two Indian nationals allegedly trafficked four Bangladesh men then made them walk from Mozambique to Komartipoort. Atif Ali, 27 and Subuj Miah, 30, are alleged to have recruited and trafficked the men and held them captive in a house in Belview Estate, Nelspruit. Information later got out that there were men held against their will and the duo was arrested. They were due to appear at the Nelspruit District Court on Friday for human trafficking charges. According to Captain Dipuo of Sekgotodi of the Hawks, the four Bangladesh nationals were freed from captivity during a joint operation by Hawks, Crime Intelligence and Nelspruit K9. She said Ali and Miah had travelled with the men from Bangdaleshi. They flew via Dakar and landed in Maputo, Mozambique. It is believed that the Bangladeshi men only realised they had been trafficked when Ali and Miah phoned their relatives in Bangladesh and demanded ransom money for their release. "The Bangladesh nationals said they were forced to walk from Maputo to South Africa until they reached Komartipoort, where they were transported to a house in Nelspruit. “The team followed up information of people who were being held captive inside." Sekgotodi said the two suspects were arrested on the premises and charge with human trafficking. The Star
