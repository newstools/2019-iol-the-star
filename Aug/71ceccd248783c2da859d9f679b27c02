Johannesburg - Foreign nationals protested outside the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Monday, calling for the release of others migrants who were arrested following raids in the CBD. The foreigners were arrested after being unable to produce documents proving that they were in the country legally and allegations that they were being being unfairly treated in custody sparked the protest. The chairperson of the African Diaspora Forum Dr Vusmuzi Sibanda believes the raids as well as arrests targeted foreign nationals. Sibanda said that even in detention, the foreign nationals have not been treated fairly in terms of the Constitution. The reason they had gone to court, SibandaÂ said, was to find out how they would be represented. "Mind you, the people that have been arrested have been denied access to legal representation. Over the weekend we tried to speak with them and we were denied that," said Sibanda. He said they were also denied food and that their families had not been allowed to see them. "A lot of them had documents and when they presented them, police did not even look at them, " said Sibanda. Sibanda said that there were people who are detained who had just come into the country for a couple of days for shopping. He further claimed that some of the documents went missing after being given to the Department of Home Affairs. The Star
