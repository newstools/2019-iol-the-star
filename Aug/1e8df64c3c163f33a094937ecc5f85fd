"We wish to thank the medical team that attended to him for their medical interventions and unwavering support during David’s stay in hospital. Mr. Kekana is survived by his mother, sister, father and two daughters," he said. Before Kekana was famously known for his soccer expertise on TV, he was a Maths and English teacher at JS Mpanza Primary School in Diepkloof. He started his journalistic career as a Sunday Time’s reporter in 1999 and also at Primedia and M-Net as a sports correspondent. He rose to prominence after joining the SABC as a sports analyst in 2001.     I'm shocked and saddened to hear of the death of former colleague David Kekana. I worked with David for years on SABC Sport, where he was a wonderful analyst. He would joke we were twins - both named David, both born on 2 November and both married to white women. #RIPDavidKekana According to Ncube, Kekana was a passionate contributor to South African sport, especially soccer and left an indelible mark on the sporting fraternity. Kekana also played numerous roles in the sports administration such as serving as Baroka Football Club Managing Director.     Terrible news to wake up to, #RIPDavidKekana 💔💔 I'm touched because I grew up seeing the face on television almost every weekend, ever smiling and soft spoken.
