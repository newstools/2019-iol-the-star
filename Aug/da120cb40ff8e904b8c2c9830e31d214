Speaking to EWN, Tsoeu said the woman shouted ‘I will shoot you and your baboon’ as she was pepper-spraying them. The 30-year-old woman said she pushed her door open and stepped outside as the pepper-spray was all over her vehicle and she was scared for her son’s life. While the pepper-spray left her son with a swollen face and red eyes, her attacker and companion laughed as they sped off, she said. Vanderbijlpark police spokesperson Sergeant Gertrude Makhale confirmed the incident and said police were investigating a common assault case. She added that the case may change depending on the outcomes and that more charges may also be added once investigations have been concluded. Makhale said the Tsoeu was busy breastfeeding her 4-month-old son when she was attacked by an unknown white female. She added that police managed to track the suspect’s vehicle and it pointed to Komatipoort in Mpumalanga. The Star
