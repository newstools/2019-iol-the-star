Johannesburg - Four taxi commuters died when the vehicle they were travelling in rammed into the back of a bus on the M1 north between Xavier and Booysens off-ramps, in Ormonde on Thursday morning.  A car that was approaching behind also hit the taxi from the back immediately after the crash, resulting in a three car pile up.  The taxi was travelling from Protea Glen, Soweto at the time of the accident.  Just as paramedics and police were dealing with that accident, another one happened not far from the first one.  Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said the second accident led to a five car pile up and the cause was not yet known.  He said while no one from the second accident died, there were 15 injuries from both the first and second accidents.  "Four cases of culpable homicide have been opened. The accident will be investigated to see who caused it, how it was caused and the person fond to be responsible will be prosecuted," Minnaar said.  On Sunday, 10 peopleÂ  died when a taxi that was allegedly speeding crashed into a concrete barrier in Midrand. The Star
