Johannesburg - A Randfontein creche owner and one of her employees were taken in for questioning after a video emerged showing children being slapped at her daycare centre. Police are looking for another employee who allegedly also assaulted the children. Randfontein Police Station Commander Brigadier Mashole Manamela said the video was brought to their attention on Thursday. In the video, he said, children can be seen being smacked. "We immediately sent police officers to go and check. We also contacted the parents of the three children in the video who said their children were assaulted at creche. They opened cases of common assault." Manamela said after the cases were opened they took in two suspects, the owner and one of the employees. He said police are still trying to ascertain the whereabouts of a second employee. "The two were arrested but not put in the cells. They were questioned and investigations are continuing. "After the video emerged, parents went to pull out their children from the creche and the Department of Social Development got involved. They went to check on, among other things, compliance." This latest incident comes a few months after another West Rand creche also found itself in the middle of a storm following the emergence of videos in April, showing a worker assaulting children at Ninnie's Neuron's Nursery. The woman, Nellie Senwametsi, was later arrested and charged with assault. She is due to appear in court next month. It was subsequently found that the creche was operating illegally and it was shut down. The Star
