Wealthy children are also more likely to take drugs, according to an NHS survey released this week. Experts called the figures a “disturbing reflection of lax middle-class parenting” and urged those with children to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to underage drinking. They suggested affluent parents were more likely to offer children a glass of wine with meals, without realising this puts their health at risk - and may lead to binge drinking. The study revealed that those who drink, smoke or take drugs were more likely to be anxious and unhappy. The NHS Digital survey questioned 13664 years 7 to 11 pupils - mostly aged 11 to 15 - from 193 English schools between last September and February this year. Some 13% of children from affluent families said they had drunk alcohol in the past week, and 37% had in the last year. This compared to 7% and 27% for those from poorer families. Parents are the main source of alcohol.
