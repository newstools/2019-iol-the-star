Johannesburg - Police are appealing for help in finding the killers of a 71-year-old Modimolle woman who was found dead in her house a week ago. Trudy Grabe was found dead on August 23. There was no one else in the house at the time. Limpopo police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said they got a call around 7am that a woman had been found injured in her house. He said police swiftly responded with paramedics on tow and Grabe was found lying in her yard with multiple injuries all over her body. Paramedics later declared her dead. “The preliminary investigations have revealed that one of the deceased's previous worker was seen leaving the house on the same day before the woman's body was found lying in the yard,” Mojapelo said. “The case of murder was opened for investigations and police are requesting Morris Maripa [former worker], to come to Modimolle police station or to the nearest police station to assist them with the investigations in this matter,” Mojapelo added. Police urge anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects involved in this matter to contact Detective Sergeant Amanda Rossouw at 071 133 8524 or the Crime Stop number on 08600 10111 or the nearest Police Station.
