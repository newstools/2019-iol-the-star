Des Werner and Werner Froneman were killed when their small plane crashed in Tanzania on Saturday. The plane caught fire. A statement on the U-Dream Global: Cape to Cairo Challenge Facebook page said: “U-Dream Global: Cape to Cairo Challenge is devastated to report that there has been an accident of the flight support aircraft and that the project directors, Des Werner and Werner Froneman, have lost their lives. No one else was involved in the accident.” Condolences for both men poured in on the social media site. Tanzanian authorities confirmed the four-seater plane entered their airspace from Uganda en route to Malawi. It made a distress signal about engine failure before disappearing off the radar. “The plane, owned by a South African organisation known as U Dream Global, was destroyed by fire after the crash. Only the engine and some parts of the plane were recovered. “The pilot and passenger, both South African citizens, were killed in the plane crash that occurred shortly after take-off from Tabora Airport at around 7.30 am,” Sikonge district commissioner Peres Magiri said. Werner and Froneman were behind the ambitious Cape to Cairo flight that saw a group of Western Cape schoolchildren build a plane and fly it to Egypt.
