Gauteng Department of Social Development spokesperson Thabiso Hlongwane said during an investigation it was found that the centre was not complying with the Children’s Act. “Our officials found that there was no health certificates, conformity of approval, and no safety fire certificate,” he said. In the video footage, the children were seen playing close to a jungle gym. A woman carrying a broom runs after one child and strikes the youngster on the head. Another woman was seen walking towards a child and appeared to hit her several times. She then lifted the crying child out of the feeding chair and walked away with her. Gauteng police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini said they were investigating a case of common assault. He said the trio was taken in for questioning last week and they were now working on finalising the investigation. “We have also interviewed several families and witnesses. No one has been arrested. Once the investigation is complete, we will then take the case to the prosecutor for a decision. From there, we can start to make arrests,” said Dlamini.
