Johannesburg - Two Polokwane police officers were arrested for allegedly demanding a bribe from an unlicensed motorist instead of arresting him for knocking down and killing a pedestrian. The officers, were nabbed a year later after an accident report into the incident revealed that no one had been arrested for the pedestrian's death. Investigations led the police to the two officers who were later arrested. They appeared at the Polokwane Regional Court on Wednesday where they were later released on bail. According to Limpopo spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, the duo's arrest emanate from an investigation that was launched following an incident of culpable homicide which occurred in August last year. It is alleged that on the day of the incident, a pedestrian was killed after being hit by a car which was driven by a man who did not possess a driver’s license. It is understood that the man was arrested by the two officers, who instead of locking him up demanded R10 000 and released him. After investigations were concluded, the officers were arrested by Polokwane police station’s station commander, Brigadier Gift Makhubele while reporting for night duty on Tuesday He said the 35-year-old sergeant and 34-year-old constable were charged with corruption and defeating the ends of justice after they allegedly asked for R10 000 from a suspect arrested for culpable homicide before releasing him. Mojapelo said the driver has not yet been arrested as investigations were underway.  The Star
