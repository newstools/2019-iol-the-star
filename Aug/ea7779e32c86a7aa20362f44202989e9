Johannesburg police arrested a woman who pretended to be a police officer and together with an accomplice allegedly robbed two foreigners who were in the city to buy stock for their business. The woman and the man, who is still at large, allegedly robbed the pair of R5000 and she was caught with some of the money. According to Johannesburg Central police spokesperson Captain Xoli Mbele, the two confronted the victims at Noord Street, told them they were police officers and asked for their passports. "When the victims told them they left their passports at home, the suspects demanded R2000 from each of them,” Mbele said. He added that the suspects then walked with the victims around the CBD where they searched them and R5000 from them by the bogus officers who then fled the scene. Mbele further added that the victims screamed for help and the 41 year old woman was caught by community members. He said police officers later rescued the woman from the angry mob that was about to beat her up. Mbele said the woman was found in possession of R2050 believed to be part of the money taken from the victims. She faces charges of impersonating police, kidnapping and extortion, Mbele said. Police urged anyone who knows the whereabouts of the male suspect to contact their nearest police station or Crime Stop on 08600 10111. The Star
