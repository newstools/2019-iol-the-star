The home of about 170 people, Noverna Court is in arrears for unpaid water and electricity and in a bid to recoup the money, Mashaba on Monday reduced the water pressure to the building and threatened to cut off its electricity. This followed a meeting with the tenants as part of operation Buya Mthetho (bring back the rule of law). The campaign, which was introduced last year, is meant to eliminate the lawlessness that takes place in Joburg communities, the hijacking of buildings and the illegal connections of electricity and water that lead to the non-payments of rates. The city’s group head of operations, Lufuno Mashau, said a company leasing the building from the city had paid R1m in June, but that R1.7m was still outstanding. “We are here today with Joburg Water to reduce water pressure.” With a lowered water pressure, simple tasks like filling up a cup of water would take a lot longer, and the building’s showers would not be nearly as effective, he said.
