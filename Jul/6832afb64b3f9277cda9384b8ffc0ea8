Johannesburg - Black First Land First (BLF) said it will appeal the decision by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC)’s decision to deregister them as a political party. The electoral commission announced the deregistration of BLF on Monday, after the Freedom Front Plus (FF Plus) appealed to the commission to have the party deregistered. FF Plus’ appeal for BLF to be deregistered emanated from the party’s constitution that only allows black people to hold membership. Speaking on Jacaranda FM on Tuesday morning, the BLF’s deputy president Zanele Lwana said the party has done sufficient work to explain why they are a blacks-only organisation and added that they were going to continue explaining why they are a blacks-only party. The electoral commission initially said the party had not contravene the law, as the Constitution pointed out to an ideology in lieu of race. Lwana said the electoral commission has succumbed to the pressure put by the ‘racist’ FF Plus to deregister BLF as a political party. “We believe this is a wrong decision to deregister our movement as a political party, that is why we are going to study the judgement for the next few days and we are going to take this matter immediately on appeal,” she added.
