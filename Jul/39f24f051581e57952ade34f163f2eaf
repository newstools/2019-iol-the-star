Katlehong - Police responding to a domestic violence complaint got more than what they bargained for when they found police uniform and an unlicensed firearm at the suspect's house. The 45-year-old Katlehong man had on Monday allegedly assaulted his girlfriend who then ran to her own place. While there, she called the police and reported her boyfriend for beating her up. According to Gauteng police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, police who were on a routine patrol attended to the matter and the woman led them to the man's place. Dlamini said as officers arrested the man, they also searched his house and found police uniform that includes a bullet proof vest, and an unlicensed 9mm pistol with 16 live rounds. He further added that further investigations were being conducted to establish if the suspect may be linked to any crimes. “The suspect will be charged with assault, possession of an unlicensed firearm and possession of articles of police uniform in terms of the South African Police Service Act ,” he said. Dlamini urged victims of domestic violence to report incidents of domestic violence as soon as they happen, as they may become fatal and also affect other family members especially where the perpetrators are in possession of firearms.
