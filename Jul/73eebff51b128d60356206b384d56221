This was after a minibus taxi driver appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court last week on a rape charge. Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department officers arrested a 31-year-old minibus taxi driver at the corner of Von Wielligh and Wemmer Jubilee streets at 9pm on Wednesday, Johannesburg Central Police Station spokesperson Captain Xoli Mbele said. A 23-year-old woman had boarded a minibus taxi from Naturena to the Bree Street taxi rank at 6pm. During the trip, the taxi driver offloaded passengers until she was the only one left. When it arrived at the Bree Street rank, the driver locked the doors and sped off to a secluded place. The suspect was captured on CCTV cameras dragging the woman into a bush and undressing her. Police officers were dispatched immediately and arrested the suspect. He appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Women raped by taxi drivers should contact Sergeant Qondile Mkhabela of the family violence, child protection, and sexual offences unit at 0763635770. - African News Agency (ANA)
