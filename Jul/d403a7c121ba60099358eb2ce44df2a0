The "Huku" hitmaker is the first South African female musician to win the award at a powerful and show-stopping ceremony included a lineup of artists, entertainers, cultural icons and inspiring humanitarians across more than 18 categories which took place at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on June 23. "This win is huge; and like I said in my speech you can really be from anywhere and be able to get anywhere. You also don't need to change yourself for that to happen. What has been a highlight for me at the awards meeting people and getting pictures with a lot of dope people. Cardi B congratulated me and I thought that was really sweet. People in general where quite excited for me and everyone could see that it was an emotional moment for me. I was actually shocked and completely taken by surprise when my name was called."
