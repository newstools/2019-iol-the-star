Soweto - The body of a 13-year-old alleged train surfer was found in an embankment beneath a railway line near the Merafe train station on Sunday. According to Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst, the teenager sustained an injury to his head and it is believed he had fallen from a moving train. “Paramedics rushed to Tsamaiso Street, near the Merafe train stop, at around 14.20 to find the teenager at the bottom of the embankment, next to the stream,” Herbst said. Herbst added that the rescue team set up a rope and basket system to retrieve the boy’s body from the embankment. Herbst said both tracks were closed off to allow the rescue team to retrieve the victim’s body from the embankment. On June 26, a 17-year-old boy succumbed to his injuries after he was knocked by a train next to the Naledi bridge, between Naledi and Protea North. At the end of May, another teenager died while standing on the roof of a train in Roodepoort. In February, an alleged 15-year-old train surfer was hit by a train along the Naledi railway corridor. The boy was declared dead on the scene by paramedics.
