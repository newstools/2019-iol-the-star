The actor and his two accomplices were arrested by a Hawks operation at Southgate Mall in Joburg and face seven charges, including impersonating police, kidnapping and extortion, along with two accomplices. The men, aged between 27 and 38, allegedly attempted to extort money from a businessman. “It is alleged that the businessman was contacted by one of the suspects in June this year and claimed that he was referred to him by his partner,” Hawks spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said. Mulamu said at a house in Klopperpark, east of Joburg, it is alleged that one the suspects placed diamonds on the table. Then the other two suspects in the scheme presented themselves as police officials. “They demanded a R100 000 bribe from the businessman to quash the illegal diamond deal,” she said. They allegedly forced him to withdraw R31000 before setting him free. On Friday police arrested the suspects in a sting operation at Southgate Mall.
