Johannesburg - Singer Johnny Clegg  was buried on Wednesday, a day after losing his battle with pancreatic cancer. According to ENCA, the legendary artist was buried on Wednesday afternoon at Westpark cemetery. His manager Roddy Quin said it had been Clegg's wish to have a private burial. “Johnny was buried yesterday (Wednesday) at 16h30, just with his family and some of the band members, it was a very private affair which is what the family requested and it was also Johnny’s request,” Quin is quoted as having said. He also said details about Clegg's public memorial service would be announced soon. Clegg's son Jesse, wrote a heartfelt tribute to his dad after his death in which he thanked him for creating a special place in his life for his family.     "I will miss you deeply and struggle to imagine a world without you," part of the message read. In 1989, Clegg and his band Savuka, released an album called Cruel, Crazy, Beautiful World. The album contained a song of the same title which Clegg wrote as dedication to Jesse who had been born a year earlier. The album cover was of a picture of Clegg carrying Jesse on his shoulders.
