“The reason for this is because a title deed is issued to the legitimate beneficiary with an endorsement that it will require an exemption or government rejecting the mandatory buy-back offer for that property to be transferred to another person. "If you buy the house within the eight years of allocation, it will not be easy to change the title deed,” member of mayoral committee for human settlements Lesiba Mpya said. City of Ekurhuleni spokesperson Nhlanhla Cebekhulu said the selling of RDP houses undermined the government’s intention of eradicating homelessness. “It is so because those beneficiaries who sell RDPs are vulnerable persons who may not be able to acquire a home of their own after selling their RDPs. "They therefore resort to returning to shacks. In terms of the Housing Act 107 of 1997, a beneficiary may not sell the house within the first eight years of having taken occupation.” Cebekhulu said if the beneficiary of the RDP house wished to sell the house, the government had first preference to buy it and reallocate it to persons on the government-housing waiting list.
