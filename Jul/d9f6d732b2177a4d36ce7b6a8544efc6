This emerged on Wednesday when she appeared in the Randburg Magistrate's Court. The prosecutor asked the matter to be postponed to next month to allow the State to formulate more charges against Phamotse. The hearing lasted for less than five minutes. A source close to the investigation confirmed to The Star that the State was hoping to add more charges against the accused but did not want to give further details on the matter. Last year, Phamotse was charged with crimen injuria after she violated a court order barring her from mentioning the couple in her social media and other platforms. This was after she had penned a book, "I tweet what I like So sue me!"Â  which mentioned the names of the Kumalos. Before the book, Phamotse had posted several tweets which seemingly offended the couple. The Kumalos later won the harassment case via the courts. Ian Levitt, the couple's attorney, said his clients remain steadfast and will stay the course however long it takes to bring justice not only to themselves but also to others that have been bullied and continue to be bullied on social media.
