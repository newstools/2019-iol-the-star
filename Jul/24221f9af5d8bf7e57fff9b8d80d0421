"It is assumed that it could have severely harmful psychological consequences in the long term and that it can thus affect the psychiatric nurses’ self-esteem, social status and happiness," said Professor Poggenpoel "The importance of nursing staff’s roles and attitudes in the interaction with the psychiatric environment which should ultimately strive to create a therapeutic milieu. This implies that the psychiatric nurse’s interpersonal skills play an extremely important role in the creation of such an ideal milieu in the work environment." Professor Poggenpoel said in general hospital settings, aggression was commonly assumed to be most prevalent in emergency departments, where dealing with aggression was a significant concern. "The incident reports indicate that events are numerically more common on medical, geriatric and psychiatric wards," she said. “It is clear that attention should be given to create opportunities for psychiatric nurses to master the management of experienced aggression from colleagues,” said Professor Poggenpoel. Professor Poggenpoel has been a tenured professor in Psychiatric Nursing Science at the University Of Johannesburg since 1989 and was an expert regarding qualitative as well as quantitative research methodologies.
