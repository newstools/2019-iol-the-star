Johannesburg - The chief executive officer of the Dr Yusuf Dadoo Hospital in Krugersdorp has dismissed claims that their TB patients are suffering in the cold due to non functioning heaters at the facility. This comes after allegations by the Democratic Alliance’s Jack Bloom who said heaters at the hospital haven’t been working for six weeks. Bloom claimed that two out of three electric heaters in the female TB ward were broken. He said the ward was in a prefabricated structure that gets very cold in winter. "There are about 25 patients in this ward who are usually there for three months as they recover from TB. "Extreme cold could be life-threatening for these patients, but the broken heaters have not been fixed even though staff have pleaded for this. It is one more example of poor maintenance and broken equipment at Gauteng state hospitals. How difficult is it to repair or replace a heater?" Sofohlo said the allegations were untrue. “Only two out of six electric heaters in the TB wards are not working. Due to bad weather we have procured additional 10 electric heaters to augment the ones we have,” Sofohlo said. He also said that policy on TB patients was that windows shouldn’t be closed for ventilation reasons. Bloom urged the Gauteng Health Department to ensure that there are functioning heaters in the TB ward as soon as possible. The Star
