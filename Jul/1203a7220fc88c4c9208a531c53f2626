 I hope #MasterChefAU announces an all woman team of expert hosts. It’d be nice if they could confirm none of them were expert at #WageTheft too.  Does #GeorgeCalombaris really need a pay rise? I mean, it’s not like he’s paying his restaurant staff. 💁🏻‍♀️ #MasterChefAU https://t.co/mT2VpnC0z7  Oh, the IRONY of greedy Lib cheerleader George Calombaris quitting #MasterChefAU over not being paid enough, whilst significantly underpaying his own staff. #MasterTheft #AusPol pic.twitter.com/O3Qvpl70ne
