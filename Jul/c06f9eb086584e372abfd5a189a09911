Braamfischerville - The Joburg Metro Police had their hands full on Friday dealing with a service deliver protest that erupted in Braamfischerville. The angry community took to the streets and blocked Elias Motsoaledi and Braamfischer Roads with rocks and tyres. A community member alleged on Twitter  that the area had been without electricity for almost a month. “Please advise @Eskom_SA to come to Braamfischerville to commence restoration work, maybe they'll understand, it's been more than a month without electricity & the power utility does not seem to care,” the tweet read. According to the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar, the  protest action started at around 5am.     Minnaar added that there were no damages and injuries reported during the protest and that police were deployed to monitor the situation. “The protest affected Elias Motsoaledi Road and motorists are urged to make use of alternative roads,” Minnaar said. Last week Soweto residents also barricaded roads with stones and burning tyres, leaving commuters stranded in an attempt to force power utility Eskom to listen to their grievances following three weeks of blackouts in the area. The residents, who had been taking to the streets for a few days in a row, said they were angry with the power utility and wanted nothing but basic services delivered to them. However, Eskom blamed illegal connections and the overloading of the system for the blackouts. The Star
