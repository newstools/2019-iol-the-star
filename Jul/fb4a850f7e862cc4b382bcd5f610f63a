Johannesburg - AfriForum said it was satisfied that Duduzane Zuma finally had his day in court even though he was acquitted of any wrong doing. That, they said, was because their aim had always been to ensure that he was prosecuted like any other South African facing similar charges. The former president's son on Friday was found not guilty of culpable homicide as well as reckless and negligent driving at the Randburg Magistrate's Court. Magistrate Tebogo Thupaatlase said the State failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The case was in connection with the accident in which a Zimbabwean woman, Phumzile Dube, was killed when Zuma's Porsche hit the taxi she was travelling in five years ago on the M1 highway in Joburg. Elias Maangwale, investigator at AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit, said their aim as an organisation had been to make sure that Zuma stated his case in a court for judgment, just as any other citizen against whom a prima facie case exists. "AfriForum achieved this goal and abides by the court’s decision,” he said. The National Prosecuting Authority had initially declined to prosecute Zuma, citing insufficient evidence. However, it was only after AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit applied to prosecute Zuma privately, that the NPA  overturned its initial decision and instituted prosecution. The Star
