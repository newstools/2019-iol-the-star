He has already been slapped with 13 life terms and 340 years behind bars. Mokoena and his accomplices, Lungelo Nkambule and Welile Mazwi, were on Tuesday each given another 20 years. The trio was sentenced for a crime they committed in April 2017. The men raped and robbed a female passenger during their reign of terror in the Joburg South region. The areas include Booysens, Meadowlands, Kliptown, Joburg Central, Rosebank and Alberton. The three men kidnapped and raped the victim after she boarded the taxi in Ridgeway, and forcefully took her belongings before travelling to various ATMs. Criminal proceedings are continuing in other cases against Mazwi, who was caught on CCTV using the victimâ€™s bank card. Dlamini said that other incidents of rape, kidnapping and robbery had been reported in which the same modus operandi was used. The taxi drivers would kidnap, rape and rob innocent women boarding their taxis. Two more taxi drivers, Nothile Dlamini and Tsepo Masiya, are already serving 60-years sentences, and three others are still on trial for related cases. The Star
