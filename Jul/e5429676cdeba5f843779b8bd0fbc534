He alleged that he was and is a victim of a conspiracy to bring him down by certain spies which he pointed out as one of his former cabinet ministers, Ngoako Ramatlhodi, in particular. It is unfortunate that he didn’t want to elaborate further on his accusations. This then makes us to wonder if he is really telling the truth. It was him who appointed Ramatlhodi as a cabinet minister. Why would he appoint someone who is a spy if he really was indeed a spy? Why was Zuma quiet for so long when Ramatlhodi was serving as the secretary to Oliver Tambo during the exile years with him as the head of intelligence? Zuma is taking us for a ride here. He thinks by playing the victim card he will divert attention to others. The fact of the matter here is that Zuma has a lot more to answer about his involvement with the Guptas. We don’t want things that are not even related to the state capture that he only mentioned to defocus the attention from him. It can’t be false that all the people who implicated him during their testimonies are also against him and are part of the plan to take him out of the picture. We need more relevant answers from him, not his false narratives about his imaginary spies.
