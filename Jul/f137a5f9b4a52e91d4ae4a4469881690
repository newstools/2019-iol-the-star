An angry Lesufi said his department would not rebuild the school. “People of Katlehong, this is what is left of Katlehong Primary School because the community is protesting against a lack of electricity. This is completely unacceptable. Forget it if you think we will fix it! You will see to finish (sic),” he said in a tweet in which he attached photographs showing the damage to the school building. Katlehong residents have been complaining about power cuts in recent years, with some saying on social media that they went without electricity for months. Residents resorted to protests by blocking roads with rocks and burning tyres. According to City of Ekurhuleni spokesperson Themba Gadebe, the frequent power outages were the result of illegal connections and tampering with power lines. “Demand for electricity is much higher during winter, compared to the rest of the year. The high loads registered at our substations can also be attributed to high levels of illegal connections as well as tampering with the electrical network,” Gadebe said. He said the City’s energy department was attending to residents’ complaints. - African News Agency (ANA)
