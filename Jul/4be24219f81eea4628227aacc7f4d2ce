The global day of former president Nelson Mandela’s birthday is aimed at celebrating his efforts to improve the lives of the less fortunate. To celebrate Madiba's birthday - he would be 101 if he were alive - paediatric patients at the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital radio station in Cape Town got a chance to interview the president. He visited the hospital to celebrate Mandela Day. Ramaphosa joined the sick children to chat to the aspirant journalists about the future of South Africa. The radio station is run by children and former patients. Since 2016, the station has served as a platform for patients to be trained as reporters. They asked Ramaphosa why children could not vote, and what his relationship with Madiba was like. The UN General Council in 2009 declared July 18 International Mandela Day. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees on Twitter called for people to emulate Mandela’s life. The commissioner said: “Mandela was a champion for peace and inclusion. “His compassion and solidarity for the persecuted are unparalleled,” he pointed out.
