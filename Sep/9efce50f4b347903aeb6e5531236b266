Johannesburg - Three suspects in the Amy'Leigh de Jager kidnapping case will appear at the Vanderbijlpark Magistrate’s Court on Thursday where they are expected to apply for bail. The suspects, Pieter Van Zyl, 50, Leticia Nell, 40 and Tharina Human, 27 are believed to have been behind the snatching of the six-year-old from her mother’s car outside Laerskool Kollegepark in Vanderbijlpark on Monday, September 2. She and her little brother were getting out of the car at the time. Four balaclava-clad men shoved her brother to the side before grabbing the girl and making off with her in an unmarked white Toyota Fortuner. She was returned unharmed to her family a day later following intense media coverage and a frantic search for the little girl. The victim was found on the street close to The Shakespeare Inn hotel in Vanderbijlpark in the early hours of Tuesday, September 3 and was taken to the police station, where she was reunited with her family. Van Zyl, Nell, and Human made their first appearance on September 9 and were remanded in custody. Human is a teacher at the little girl's school and also the friend to the mother child. She has since been suspended from her teaching post. The Star
