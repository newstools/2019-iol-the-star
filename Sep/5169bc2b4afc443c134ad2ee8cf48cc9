The South African flag continues to fly high with leading lady Terry Pheto. The star took home the Best Actress actress award at the fifth annual British Urban Film Festival (BUFF) Awards which took place at the weekend in London. FACES, the movie for which she took home an award, also won Best Feature Film. In absentia due to her obligations as a jury member for the 92nd Annual Academy Awards (Oscars) for Best Foreign Film, Pheto said it was a surreal feeling to win the nod.     ‪Woke up to the amazing news that I won Best Actress Award at the British Urban Film Festival Awards last night in London.
