Johannesburg - Joburg Central police arrested three suspects aged between 42 and 51 for impersonating police and extortion on Sunday morning. According to Johannesburg Central police spokesperson Captain Xolani Mbele, police were conducting a routine foot patrol when they spotted two men at the corners of Jeppe and Small streets around 11am searching someone. “They saw two males showing a person something before they searched him. They then stopped the two men and upon searching them they found two police rank badges in their possession,” Mbele said. He added that the two suspects were arrested on the spot. Mbele further added that minutes later, police arrested  a 42-year-old woman for impersonating police officers and extortion at the corners of Noord and Klein Streets. The woman had allegedly demanded a passport from a woman who was with her boyfriend. "The boyfriend did not have a passport in his possession and the suspect demanded payment of R300 or the man will be arrested,” Mbele said. “The woman gave her R200 and the suspect still demanded R300. The woman then saw two police officers and alerted them,” he added. The woman was searched and the R200 was recovered. She was also arrested. Mbele said investigations were under way and suspects would appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate Court soon. The Star
