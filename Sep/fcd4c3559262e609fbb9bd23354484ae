Johannesburg - An illegal miner was arrested for murder and attempted murder after two people were shot dead and four others wounded at Kromdraai informal settlement, Krugersdorp on Tuesday morning. According to Captain Raymond Sebonyane of Krugersdorp Corporate Communication, members from the District Intervention Team attended to a complaint of shooting between zama zamas just after after midnight on Tuesday. Sebonyane said as officers were walking along Kromdraai road, the zama zamas started shooting at them and they returned fire, resulting in suspects fleeing the scene. “During preliminary investigations police found one suspect who was wounded on the lower part of body and he was in possession of an unlicensed firearm with it's serial number filed off. He was arrested and taken to Leratong Hospital where he is under police guard,” Sebonyane added. Police received another complaint from the same scene and upon arrival at the scene, two men aged between 25 and 45 were found dead while four others were injured. “Two of the injured suspects sustained gunshot wounds, whereas another two were hit with a hammer. The injured people were taken to the nearest hospital for treatment, he said. “It was later found that the first suspect was part of the rival group from either Soweto or Munsieville. Krugersdorp police are investigating further,” he added. Sebonyane said the suspect who is under police guard would appear at Krugersdorp Magistrate Court in due course. The Star
