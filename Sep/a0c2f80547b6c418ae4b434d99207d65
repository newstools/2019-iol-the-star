Although the 23 082 incidents noted in the 2018/2019 financial year are 180 less than in the 2017/2018 financial year, they are still more than double that in other provinces.

In the 2018/2019 financial year, 567 incidents of hijackings as well as robberies at both residential and business areas were reported at the Ivory Park Station  Although the number was less that those reported in the past financial year, it has consistently had very high incidents reported there since 2014.
