Johannesburg - Metrobus services will resume on Monday after a five day strike during which the bus agency took court action against the union and won. The Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa  (Demawusa) strike ended on Friday following an application to the Labour Court by Metrobus. Normal bus services will resume on Monday. Metrobus spokesperson Goodwill Shivuri said the service regrets the inconvenience and assures commuters that no efforts were spared to ensure that the industrial action lasted for a minimal period. According to the union, employees are demanding to be paid salary progressions on the basis of the number of years of service, based on three-year periods of accumulated service. Members also want to be allocated offices at all three Metrobus depots. When the strike started last week Demawusa allegedly hijacked a Metrobus in the early hours. The bus was travelling from Roodepoort to Ghandi Square in Johannesburg CBD when it was hijacked. The driver was forced out of the bus but was not harmed during the process. He reported the matter to the police and the bus was later found at Ghandi Square. There were no passengers in the bus at the time and Shiburi said at the time that the hijack looked like a plan to intimidate those who were not part of the strike. The Star
