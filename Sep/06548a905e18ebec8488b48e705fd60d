According to The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) Chief David Tember, the JMPD K9 unit followed on information received from a resident about suspicious behaviour where people were making rounds in and out of a house with drums and buckets.

He said police then opened one of the curtains by the sliding door and were surprised by what appeared to be a drug lab. MMC for Public Safety Michael Sun said the police confiscated chemicals and machinery with an estimated value of R3 million and added that no suspect was found in the house at the time. “The house owner will be traced and investigated.
