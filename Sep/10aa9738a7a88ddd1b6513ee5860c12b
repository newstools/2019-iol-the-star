Johannesburg - SABC's board chairperson Bongumusa Makhathini was on Monday expected to appear before Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo at the Commission of Inquiry Into State Capture. Group Chief Executive Officer Madoda Mxakwe and Group Executive: News and Current Affairs Phathiswa Magopeni were to also join Makhathini at the inquiry. According to a statement from the public broadcaster,  the trio "will cooperate and provide all the necessary information as required by the Commission. "The SABC will provide a full statement on the evidence presented, once all SABC representatives have appeared before the Commission." The appearance of Makhathini, Mxakwe and Magopeni comes a month after veteran journalist Joe Thloloe released a report on the findings of a commission that was appointed to investigate editorial interference at the SABC under former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng. The commission found that there had been serious editorial interference at the SABC and that from 2012 until 2017, the public broadcaster's executives took instructions from people with no editorial authority, including from former board chairperson Ellen Tshabalala and former communications minister Faith Muthambi. “The executives thus failed to execute their duties in terms of the Editorial Policies. The commission further found that Nothando Maseko, Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane and Nyana Molete were pivotal to the execution of instructions from Hlaudi Motsoeneng, Jimi Matthews and Simon Tebele. They succumbed because of threats of dismissal from their immediate superiors,” Thloloe said at the time. The Star
