He was shot on Tuesday as the violence and looting of shops spread across Gauteng. Sebuku was one of the seven people to have died since the violent attacks erupted on Sunday. Karabo Ditire, 17, Mduduzi Mchunu and Zimbabwean-born Fortunate Dondai died in Coronationville, Jeppestown and Hillbrow, respectively. An unknown man also died in Hillbrow on Monday while two more victims were found burnt in Alexandra on Wednesday. Sebuku’s sister, Tsholofelo Sebuku, told The Star that Isaac was a well-behaved man who loved soccer and had an entrepreneurial spirit. “He wasn't someone who was unruly, and that is why were surprised about what happened because he stayed alone here and we never heard any complaints about him,” she said. “Cheese boy”, as the family affectionately called him, was self-reliant, said Tsholofelo. Ditire’s sister, Slyvia Ditire, 31, said her brother went to see what was causing the commotion and was shot in the head. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed that they were investigating the circumstances around the discovery of two bodies found in Alexandra on Wednesday. Sebuka will be laid to rest on Sunday and Ditire next week, both in Madibogo Pan, North West.
