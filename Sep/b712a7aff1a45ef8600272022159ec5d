After a decade of low growth and deepening poverty, people are looking for signs of progress in tackling the many challenges confronting our country. These concerns are real. "This year, the economy will record growth that is lower than expected (and much lower than what we need). Government finances are stretched about as far as they can go, and several industries are looking at retrenching workers," Ramaphosa said via the first official post on Monday. He said much of the confidence that the country had 20 months ago has dissipated as the reality of the problems became clearer. "This confidence was born out of the hope that we would quickly undo the damage that was done over a number of years. Implementing change does take time. The important issue is that we should move in a determined way to effect change while remaining irrevocably committed to rooting out state capture, corruption and malfeasance. "We collectively have a common task: to rebuild the confidence of our people, this time based not merely on hope and expectation of change, but on concrete things that make a difference in the economy, real actions that â€˜move the needleâ€™. I believe this is eminently possible. "Despite the difficulties, South Africans from all walks of life are still moved by the spirit ofÂ Thuma MinaÂ to become involved in fixing our country. They want to change the narrative of doubt to a narrative of opportunity not through clever spin, but through action. South Africans are ready to rise to the challenge.
