According to The Sydney Morning Herald, the 26-year-old is leading accusations of sexual and indecent assault, and accused Jones of raping her in South Africa 2013. Sparkes filed the police report in Queensland, alleging that she was a victim of revenge porn, which is a crime in Australia, and sexual assault. Her allegations come hot on the heels of the zef band having to deal with the controversy of footage emerging of them involved in an alleged homophobic attack and making racist remarks, prompting organisers of festivals to cancel their performances. Their manager Jay Savage has also spoken out about the group’s conduct. Savage, the former head of Sony ATV publishing in SA, had known Jones since 1995. “He was always extremely dishonest and would lie to your face but he hadn’t yet developed the kind of malice and callousness that came later,” Savage said. Another musician in Italy has now come forward in the wake of Sparkes’s allegations, also accusing Jones of indecent assault at a concert in 2014. Jones denies both allegations.
