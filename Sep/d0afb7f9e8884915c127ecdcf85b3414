Mkhwanazi, 36, appeared in the Protea Magistrate's Court on Tuesday on charges of murder and defeating the ends of justice. In his previous appearance, the state informed the court that the trial would be heard in the South Gauteng High Court and that an indictment and trial date had not yet been received. The court heard on Tuesday that the indictment was ready, however, Mkhwanazi had another case pending for possession of an unlicensed firearm which will be incorporated into the indictment. Magistrate Zweli Zwakhe postponed the murder case for the indictment to be updated. Madiba was reported missing after she spent a weekend in Phiri, Soweto, at the home of her friend, Tshidi Mkhwanazi, in 2013. The search for the teenager went on for more than two years until 2015, when police - acting on a tip off - finally recovered human remains in a shallow grave in Mkhwanazi's backyard. Last month, police arrested the friend's uncle in connection with Madiba's murder. He remains in custody.
