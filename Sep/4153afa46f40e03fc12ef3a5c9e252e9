Johannesburg - Vanderbijlpark police are investigating two inquest cases after two siblings died of poisoning on Monday. Vanderbijlpark police spokesperson Sergeant Gertrude Makhale said the two siblings Lerato, 3 and Lucas Mosikidi, 6 were with their mother and grandmother in the Vanderbijlpark CBD when the younger child got ill . Makhale added that Lucas was left with his grandmother as the mother rushed Lerato to hospital. However, Lerato was declared dead upon arrival. Meanwhile, Lucas - who had been left with his grandmother- also got sick. The grandmother rushed him to a local doctor in the CBD but was also declared dead on arrival. According to Makhale, police were summoned to the two incidents and have opened two inquest dockets for investigation. She added that the post-mortem results revealed that both children died from poisoning and their stomach content has been taken for toxicology. Makhale said toxicology results will help establish the exact type of poison and its source, including the food they allegedly consumed before leaving home for town on the day of the incident.
