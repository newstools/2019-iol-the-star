Johannesburg - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has apologised to President Cyril Ramaphosa for airing an ‘unedited’ version of his speech on Thursday evening. The video, which is of Ramaphosa addressing gender based violence issues that have plagued the country, show the president asking the TV crew if he can 'start again' after he made a mistake in his speech. It later went viral. According to the broadcaster’s spokesperson Vuyo Mthembu, the broadcasting of the unedited version of Ramaphosa’s special address was an unfortunate breach of news production process and said they apologise for any embarrassment that came with such a broadcast.     "In a pre-recorded televised message by President Cyril Ramaphosa to the nation, the SABC inadvertently broadcast an incorrect version of the President’s speech on SABC News, while the correct version was played across all SABC radio stations. "The public broadcaster wishes to apologise to the President of the Republic and the nation for any embarrassment caused in this unfortunate breach of news production processes. "The SABC takes this issue very seriously and can assure the President and the public that due processes will be followed and appropriate action taken. The Star
