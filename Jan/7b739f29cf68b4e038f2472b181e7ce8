Instead, the university will use an online system. “For UJ, every new student is a welcome addition to our ever-growing community,” said UJ’s registrar, Professor Kinta Burger. “We look forward to our 2019 intake as the latest of a group of enquiring young minds eager to learn and to empower themselves and their communities and contribute towards nation building.” Burger advised that the application, admission and registration process was entirely online. UJ started reviewing applicants based on the final recently released Grade 12 results and would continue doing so until Sunday. “All applicants who have been provisionally or conditionally accepted for a programme of study at UJ will receive official confirmation of their final admission status via email. If applicants have not received an email by January 8, they should visit the UJ website to verify their final application status or call the UJ call centre.” Burger emphasised that no physical “walk-ins” would be accepted. “However, for prospective students who have been extremely successful in matric but failed to apply in time, the university’s late-enquiry system will be available via the website from January7 to 11. There will also be an online chat facility available on the website to assist with enquiries.”
