A man was shot in the stomach after a CIT van was robbed in Soweto on Monday morning. The incident took place in Chiawelo at a BP garage between 7am and 9am. According to a witness, a black VW Golf 5 pulled up to the garage. Two men came out of the vehicle with an R5 rifle and a pistol. The men approached the Cash-In-Transit (CIT) van and held one of the guards at gunpoint and took an undisclosed amount of money from him. The guard was collecting money from the garage. The witness then said one of the petrol attendants was shot during the commotion. Police spokesperson Captain Mtande Khoza confirmed that the petrol attendant was shot in the stomach and taken to hospital. "There is footage of the robbery that shows two suspects approaching the guard. It is still unclear how much money was taken." Khoza said the getaway car was not identified nor how many people were inside the vehicle. "The matter is still under investigation," said Khoza. He added that all the garage personnel were witnesses to the robbery. The witness, who did not want to be named, said there were six suspects in the vehicle and the robbery took about 5 minutes to complete.
