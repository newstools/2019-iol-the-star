“We are not surprised at all by the ANC Youth League of Tshwane’s stance on issues happening in the city as they have been caught up in allegations of collecting money from (embattled Tshwane city manager Moeketsi Mosola) by members of the ANC in various WhatsApp groups which we have in our position,” said Sanco Tshwane regional chairperson Abram Mashishi. “We have given our clear position to the city with regard to its role on the day of the incident (the December 28 stampede) and we will await the investigations outcome and from then onwards approach relevant institutions for recourse.” Sanco led protests outside the ECG premises in Pretoria, calling for the popular church to be expelled from the Pretoria venue. However, the ANCYL chairperson Lesego Makhubela told a media briefing on Tuesday that Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga had deliberately lied in the aftermath of the stampede when he said the premises of the ECG did not comply with fire and emergency by-laws. Contrary to Sanco’s stance, the ANCYL said it was against calls for the ECG to be removed from its site at the Pretoria showgrounds, which it rents. “We believe in the Constitution. What the DA is doing in Tshwane is similar to what that corrupt funny man (Joburg mayor) Herman Mashaba is doing promoting xenophobia. The ECG is a church of a black person, followed by multitudes of black people. “Talk that he (Bushiri) should go back to Malawi is xenophobic and we are against it. That church has a compliance certificate from Tshwane and nothing prohibits the ECG from continuing with their gatherings,” Makhubela said at the time.” African News Agency (ANA)
