On Tuesday, there was an attack on paramedics at a Lenasia filling station. The hijackers managed to get away with the emergency vehicle. The paramedics were not harmed, although they were traumatised, said Joburg EMS spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi. The damaged vehicle was later recovered at Nancefield Hostel. On Sunday, Alexandra firefighters who were monitoring New Year’s festivities were attacked by attempted hijackers, but no one was hurt. "We are very concerned about these constant attacks, which cause panic among our emergency officers who are constantly concerned about their safety,” said Mulaudzi. However, EMS did not support calls from several unions for EMS staff to carry firearms. “If they are armed they will become more vulnerable - it will create confusion. “Instead, we aim to work with community police officials to educate the public about the services being rendered by EMS officials who look after the safety of residents,” he said. Last week, a union representing para- medics encouraged its members to arm themselves. The trade union, the South African Emergency Personnel Union, which represents about 7000 paramedics, encouraged its members to carry guns to protect themselves. There have been about 30 complaints from emergency workers who had been attacked while on duty in various provinces over the past six months. On Friday, two Cape Town medics in an ambulance were held up at gunpoint while transporting a patient to Melomed Hospital in Mitchells Plain. They stopped to attend to a man lying in the road. But it was just a ruse, and he drew a gun and held them up. Last week in the Eastern Cape, a patient and paramedics were robbed of their belongings, including cellphones. About 66525 emergency medical services workers, including paramedics, ambulance assistants and emergency care technicians, are registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa. @annacox
