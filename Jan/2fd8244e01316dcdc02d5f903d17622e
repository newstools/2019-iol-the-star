The rainy weather didn't stop lovers of all things music from gathering at Constitution Hill for the second annual Afropunk Festival. Although many in attendance will have to wave goodbye to their beloved shoes because of the terrible mud, memories made on December 30 and 31 will live on. Performances included a spectacular show from Thandiswa Mazwai, US-based Kaytranada and The Internet, and many other DJs and performers. This time, an addition of themed basement parties helped with shelter from the wet weather. As expected, the music lovers came dressed in their afro chic best. From cultural attire to modern looks, it was a feast for the eyes. Goods on sale included shoes, bags, clothes, tattoos, hair products, accessories and more. The muddy grass was a problem for some but most of the music lovers were happy to sing and dance in the rain. The festival is a two-day experience of music, food stalls and a market where shop owners sell their merchandise.
