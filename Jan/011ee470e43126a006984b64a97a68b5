Janet Abrahams, a grey-haired pensioner, saw her “baby” Nicolette for the last time when they spoke about buying a comforter and boots. Weeks later, Nicolette mysteriously disappeared. Her husband Fadiel Moegamad Albertyn was found guilty of murder and defeating the ends of justice last year. The state proved to the high court in Joburg that Albertyn killed Nicolette at the home they shared in Chrisville, south of Joburg, on March 13, 2015, following a quarrel. While Nicolette’s body was never found the state relied on evidence of blood traces in the house to secure a conviction. Neighbours also confirmed hearing screams from the flat on the night Albertyn killed the mother of a now 9-year-old daughter in a fit of a rage. Sentencing proceedings in the case continued on Monday Wearing a brown leather jacket and a white Muslim hat, Albertyn sat composed in the dock.

She testified as part of aggravating factors. Asked by prosecutor Mahlubi Ntlakaza to tell court how she felt about her daughter’s passing, Abrahams said: “I do not know how I feel, but that was my baby. Because of the trauma that I have went through I have lost weight. “I cannot sleep and take sleeping pills because I do not know where my child is. I don’t know what happened that Friday night (she died).” Nicolette’s daughter believed her mother was missing, Abrahams told the court. “She only knows the mother is missing. I am taking care of her with my pension money.” Nicolette worked for Woolworths. Payout from her shares with the group and her pension cannot be accessed because she was yet to be declared dead. Proceedings were postponed to April 9.
