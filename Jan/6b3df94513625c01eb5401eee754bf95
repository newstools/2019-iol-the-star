The trio from St John’s College in Joburg just completed their matric and are looking forward to going off to university and not being a unit for the first time. The 18-year-olds - Dominic, Demarco and Donato - all achieved a bachelor pass. Donato said the best part of being a triplet was always having a friend. “You always have someone to talk to - you might not always want to, but they are there. Sometimes our interests overlap but mostly we are individualistic. Sometimes we go to the gym, play video games or play sports. I tend to read more than my brothers. It just really depends on the day,” Donato said. Donato, who plans to study biomedical engineering at Wits University, said: “Everyone is going their separate ways. We’ve all grown up doing our own individual things. It’s never been that we are co-dependent on each other. We have always been very individualistic, and being separate has never really bothered us.” Demarco agreed: “We are very different. We have developed our own personalities. We look similar but we are completely different.” Demarco admitted he was the most competitive of the three. “I try being the best in everything,” he laughed. He plans to study accounting at the University of Pretoria. “I am looking forward to being away from my brothers for the first time. People will actually see me as a completely new person,” he said. Dominic said that what made the brothers most similar was their view of the world. “At the core we are all very different but we have a similar moral compass and standing. We view things in a similar way. We have different interests, and they led us to completely different career choices.” He plans to study for a BCom at Wits University.
