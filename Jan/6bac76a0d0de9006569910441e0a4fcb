Popular comedian Marc Lottering’s most beloved alter ego, Aunty Merle Abrahams, will sashay onto the stage for the first time in Johannesburg next month. Aunty Merle, The Musical will take to the Mandela Stage in Joburg Theatre from February 1 to March 3. Written by Lottering and directed by Lara Foot, the show has received four Fleur du Cap nominations and has enjoyed two sell-out seasons in Cape Town to rave reviews. The musical is about high drama unfolding in Belgravia Road, Athlone, as Merle’s daughter, Abigail, announces her engagement to her boyfriend, Alan. As Merle puts it: “He’s a good-looking white chap.” However, Abigail’s twisted and corrupt ex, Denver Paulse, wants her back and if he fails, he threatens to reveal a dark secret, which is bound to tear the lovers apart. The show also includes Tracey-Lee Oliver as Abigail, Paul du Toit as Alan, Loukmaan Adams as Denver Paulse and a stellar support cast including Royston Stoffels, Tankiso Mamabolo, Gina Shmukler, Adrian Galley, Carmen Maarman, Zandile Madliwa, Sizwesandile Mnisi, Anzio September and Crystal Finck, accompanied by an eight-piece band. Twenty-two original songs, with lyrics by Marc Lottering and Tarryn Lamb, musical direction by Alistair Izobel and choreography by Grant Van Ster, have earned the cast standing ovations. Aunty Merle, The Musical is suitable for all ages (no under 3s). Tickets from R145 are available through Webtickets and from Pick * Pay. Performances are Wednesdays to Saturdays at 8pm, with matinées on Saturdays and Sundays at 3. Visit www.joburgtheatre.com for more information. Join in the conversation online with #MerleInJozi
