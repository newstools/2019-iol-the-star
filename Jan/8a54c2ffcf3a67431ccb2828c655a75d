Joburg Central police spokesperson Captain Xoli Mbele said the five people, aged between 28 and 62, were arrested between Thursday and Sunday. Among the suspects is a woman who colluded with two men to rob a university student. Police were working with the community police forum to curb such crimes, which had spiralled out of control, Mbele said, adding that some of the victims were attacked at gunpoint and knife point. “One suspect was apprehended for robbery at the corner of Bree and Wanderers streets. It is alleged the suspect robbed a 25-year-old male of his cellphone. The victim was walking when the suspect took his cellphone from his pocket. It was later recovered from the suspect,” Mbele said. He said three other men had robbed an 18-year-old university student of her cellphone and money at the corner of Bree and Von Brandis streets. “The victim was on her way to catch a taxi when she was confronted by a female. The woman grabbed her and she was joined by two males. They took her cellphone and R150. Community police forum team came to her rescue and the suspects were apprehended,” Mbele said. In another incident a suspect was arrested at the corner of Bree and Rissik streets. “Three suspects robbed a 34-year-old male of his cellphone. The victim was carrying groceries when they grabbed his cellphone from a pocket in his shirt,” Mbele said. He said the two accomplices were still at large and were in possession of the victim's phone. Mbele said investigations were under way. The suspects were expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Monday.
