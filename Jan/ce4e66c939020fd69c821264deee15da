EFF leader Julius Malema's call for land expropriation has resonated with many if a video that caught an altercation between two women is anything to go by. In the video that was posted on Facebook, a Coloured woman can be heard supporting Malema's call for land expropriation after an altercation with a white woman who she also threatened with a beating. The clip does not show how the fight began but the video starts with the Coloured woman shouting at the white lady who is busy laughing. "Why are you laughing, what's so funny?" the Coloured lady asks her. The white woman then responds: "They're just doing their job." The Coloured woman, however, is not impressed and says: "Don't get yourself involved in things that have got nothing to do with you because I'll start with you before I go to her." The white lady, however, says: "She's just doing her job" and continues to laugh. "Don't laugh, it's not funny. I'll  fu**en give you a backhand slap and you'll fly out of here. Shut up, it's not f***en  funny. I'll smack you, who do you think you are? Just shut up and mind your own business. The lady then continues: "Would you have been laughing like this had it been another person? You're laughing because it's you white sister." As she kept laughing, her laughter seems to raise the ire of the other woman who approaches her, touches her face and says:  "I'll fucken smack you and you will run to the police and open a case...rubbish. "That's why Julius must fu***en take the land," she says. The incident happened at Clicks store and spokesperson Susan Caminada confirmed it. "We are aware of the video and can confirm that an altercation took place between two customers at a Clicks store. We are busy investigating the matter." Caminada said they were also trying to establish at which Clicks store the incident happened. The video, which was posted on the Facebook page of Steenberg and Retreat News Ads ad Updates, has since been removed.
