Learners who have either failed or did not do as well as they expected in matric have been encouraged not to lose hope because there are many options. If you feel unhappy with your marks, you can apply for a remark from the Department of Basic Education. If you are still not satisfied with the result, you should register for supplementary exams and take another opportunity at improving those grades. The department also offers the ­Second Chance programme which provides free academic support. It enables learners to write supplementary exams for a maximum of two subjects, to meet the pass requirements of the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations. According to the department, learners who will be supported through this programme include: * Progressed learners who wrote the NSC the previous year but did not sit for all six subjects and will write the exams for the outstanding subjects in June. * Senior Certificate (amended) examination candidates registered to write the senior certificate exams in June. Registration for these are open and will close on January 31. * NSC examinations part-time candidates who attempted the NSC exams post 2015 and will write the exams in November. Registration for the 2019 NSC exams will open in the first week of January and close on March 15. Jackie Carroll, chief executive of Media Works, said: “When it comes to supplementary exams with either of these two scenarios, you cannot return to your school (for) classes. Instead, you’ll have the option of attending classes at a community college or private learning institution. “You can also prepare for your supplementary exams using online courses from Matric Works,” she said.
