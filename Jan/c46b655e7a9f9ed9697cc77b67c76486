The Yoga C930 is one of the best choices for both business and personal use. Coming with a 1TB Solid State Drive, 8th Generation Intel Core i7 processor and a 16GB memory, it has a high storage capacity, completes the boot process in just a few seconds, and the system performance is top notch. Once you’ve started it up, you’re bound to admire the 13.9-inch (35cm) UHD IPS screen, which offers a smooth touch, plus the device comes with a built-in stylus that has a charging spot, and it automatically charges when inserted back into the laptop slot. The Yoga C930 is a two in one: it can be used as a normal laptop, and the screen can flip up to 360 degrees to allow tablet mode. It comes with extra features like fingerprint authentication, webcam with a privacy shutter, and backlit keyboard. These features offer great security, privacy and convenience when working in the dark. It has a long battery life, which is good for mobility and convenience. But the device seems to have a weak cooling system; after about an hour of use it overheated. That made it rather uncomfortable to carry, especially when working in tablet mode. Another let down is the single USB 3.1 port, for a person who rather prefers using an external mouse, it means once the mouse is connected there was no way I could use an external drive. The device is too big to be a tablet and a bit on the expensive side, costing around R30000.
