The life and times of Peacock hit-maker Dan Tshanda will be celebrated at a memorial service to be held at the Baseline in Newtown, Joburg on Friday. Tshanda, 54, died at Mediclinic Sandton on Saturday after complaining of chest pains. This was a few days after returning from a family holiday in Durban. Family spokesperson Moudy Mudzielwana said Tshanda would be buried on January 18 with the service to be held at a venue still to be confirmed. Tshanda’s eldest son, Ndivhuwo, said his father’s death was sudden and they had not expected it. “Our father was a great person, a father who strived to build us up and make us feel that we can accomplish anything if we put our minds to it. “He would always say ‘fight for number one’, and I took that with me and so did they (his brothers, Lufuno and Lutendo),” Ndivhuwo said. Tshanda’s uncle, Elvis Makhari, said Tshanda gave him R700 for Christmas. “I am hurting. He made sure that I was in need of nothing. “He loved his family and I will miss his kindness,” Makhari said. Association of Independent Record Companies SA deputy president Stanley Khoza said: “It is a sad day for us. “We have lost a great man, not only a father to his family, but a son of the soil who has continued to keep the legacy of the South African sound flying beyond the borders of South Africa,” Khoza said.
