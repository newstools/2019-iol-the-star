The 22-year-old has dedicated her time to empowering the youth. “I want them to watch their actions and strategise their dreams.” This is especially so for those who are in need of mentorship, she says. As a graduate of the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, giving back was part of the school's ethos. “Mentorship is important in someone's life because as much as the internet has information, it is also limiting. Mentorship focuses on how you can be accountable for your dreams, and it helps grow the skills and education development in South Africa.” Through Bhekizenzo, Tapula runs a programme that teaches youth soft skills such as writing a CV, public speaking and self branding. “The programme also assists them with their career guidance. When you don't make it in university, instead of crying a mentor will have you think about other possibilities for yourself.” The programme supports the youth of Diepsloot and Tapula keeps in touch with the progress of the learners through communication and monitoring. She and her partners are currently working with 30 children, varying in age from 15 to 21 years. The programme takes place on Saturdays. “With events like the career expo, which allows the youth to dress into their desired careers, the learners socialise, have fun and stay intrigued.” Even though they face the challenge of funding, Tapula has never allowed that to stop her, and she has gradually found interesting ways to overcome that obstacle. Tapula’s dream is to expand her programme into the rest of the continent. Locally, she would like to develop the programme into parts of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal that have challenges with education. “My dream is to decrease the unemployment rate and build community libraries, as well as grow the industrial revolution in South Africa and bring more innovative solutions." The programme is open to youth outside of Diepsloot as well. To get in touch with the Bhekizenzo Foundation, visit their Facebook page.
