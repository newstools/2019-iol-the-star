The Kingsmead College, Melrose, matriculant, who achieved nine distinctions, has been on a two-week tour to the Italian cities of Rome, Venice and Naples, as well as to Barcelona in Spain and Paris in France. She obtained distinctions in English, Afrikaans, accounting, French, life orientation, life sciences, maths, physical science and advanced placement maths. She is her school’s top performer for 2018. The former head girl said her favourite subjects were physics, biology and French. But she didn’t concentrate only on the academic side of school. “Throughout most of my school career, I have been involved in sports and musical instruments. This taught me time management. I learnt to focus on the most important things.” She played hockey for the school’s first team and did athletics. At Kingsmead, exams were written every term, which helped her with her study plan and exam preparation. “During exams, I would have a study timetable but always tried to study beforehand,” she said. The young woman has high hopes for her future. She plans to study medicine at either Wits University or UCT. “I don’t want to be a GP or a doctor. I want to finish studying medicine and then do a PhD in genetics or something research related,” she said. Husnaa is looking forward to new experiences. “I am excited about the change. I have been mostly with the same girls since Grade R and it will be interesting to meet a diverse group of people.”
