The Emalahleni mayor had stated that there is a depression problem in the area after a 24 year old woman was arrested for allegedly killing her four children. Linah Malatjie, who was one of the people who attended the children's funeral on Tuesday, condemned their killing and said depression was a problem in the area as there had been another incident where a mother poisoned her three children. One of them died and the others were only released from the intensive care unit on Monday, she said. Malatjie, who was speaking in an interview with Enca, urged mothers to talk about their problems and also asked churches to assist. "The pastors and churches must come on board for counselling to assist young mothers but also, there is a lot of depression happening in the area of Emalahleni," she said. Malatjie also stated that the Department of Social Development services were available to those who are depressed and need help. The funeral service of the four siblings, Minenhle, 8,  Blessing, 7, Shaniqua, 3 and one year old Ethen was held at the Witbank Civic Centre. Their mother, Zintle Maditla,  appeared at the Witbank Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Her case was postponed to December 14 for a formal bail application. The children's decomposed bodies were found on December 30 in their home in Klarinet, Mpumalanga. Maditla was arrested after handing herself to the police.
