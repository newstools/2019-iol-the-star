The boy this week started Grade 8 at a Krugersdorp high school and, while excited, his mother said he struggled to cope at the end of last year because of the viral video. His mother said: “Once people saw the video, they started teasing him and that made him stop playing outside. "When we took him to the doctor for a check-up, they said he had anxiety.” The schoolboy had already been on medication for attention deficit disorder. The mother said her son was excited but anxious about interacting with the other learners. “This week is orientation and he will only be interacting with the other Grade 8s. “He is worried about what will happen next week when he meets the older children,” she said. The mother said the school was aware of the issue and the principal had been supportive. In the 51-second video, the boy is seen screaming at a male teacher, pulling him by his shirt. A female teacher then intervenes. “Leave the teacher,” she says, as he gets between the two. The boy then fights the female teacher, pushing and hitting her. The male teacher then goes towards the boy and tries to restrain him from hitting the female teacher. However, the boy lashes out at him. “Don't touch me. You stink. Did you have a bath this morning?” he shouts at him. The female teacher then says to the boy: "Don't do this. Calm down.” But the boy screams back at her: “Leave me alone. Don't touch me. Calm down for what?” The male teacher decides to walk away and the learner can be heard shouting at him, saying: “This rubbish." The female teacher continues to restrain the boy who refuses to calm down. He can also be heard threatening to “smash that car”.
