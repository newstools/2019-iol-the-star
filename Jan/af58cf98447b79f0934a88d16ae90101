These are the words award-winning hip hop artist Pitch Black Afro took from his hit song Never Let You Go and posted on Facebook on Tuesday, as he mourned the death of his wife, Catherine Tricia Modisane. Then in a twist of events police confirmed that Pitch Black Afro, real name Thulani Ngcobo, was arrested in connection with Modisane’s murder. Gauteng provincial spokesperson, Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, said Modisane was found dead on December 31. She reportedly had an argument with Ngcobo the night before she was found dead at a bed and breakfast in Bellevue, Joburg. Ngcobo was detained at Yeoville police station and was expected to appear in the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court on Thursday on a charge of murder.
