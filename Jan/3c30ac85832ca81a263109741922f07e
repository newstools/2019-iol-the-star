City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena said the two are believed to have been using the substation as a place to sleep and that it exploded when they tampered with it. "It is believed that the two tried to open MV link box with the aim of stealing some of the material when it exploded causing the fire that killed one of them. "City Power would like to warn people against vandalism and using its infrastructure as shelter as this may result in injuries or death," he said. Mangena said the substation was currently a crime scene and that their technicians would only be able restore power in the affected suburbs after the police were done with investigations.
