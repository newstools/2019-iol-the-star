  How many phones have you had and what is the current phone you are using? I have had about five phones and I’ve also acquired the talent of losing phones in recent times. I’m using an iPhone and Samsung.  How often do you use the internet to plan activities with your family? We have three family groups so the family is quite internet savvy. There’s a lot of planning and posting of silly jokes during working hours - that happens (sorry Modigas, but it’s true).  If you could create a music app, what would it do and what would it be called? I’d create a music app that can sense your feelings and play exactly what you need to hear. I’d call it “Yelloe Feel”.  Are you in any WhatsApp groups, and if so how many? I am part of endless groups. I have a few for anything band related: rehearsals, performance, updates, etc. I have a few family groups but still don’t know why. I have a few friendship groups because different friend circles cover different things and different levels of silliness. There’s quite a few and like I am sure others will relate, I usually forget to delete unused ones.  Which social media apps do you use and why? Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Photo apps, Fitness apps, Bible app, GPS. They are all mandatory to keep life’s balance.  How has technology made your life more convenient? Information is easily accessible which is always great because I’m always looking for obscure and fascinating things and being able to communicate with loved ones. The irony, though, is that sometimes technology creates an illusion on connectivity only to separate us while we are all together.  What are your thoughts on how South African celebrities use social media? I feel as though South African celebrities use media as they wish, which is all you can do as long as there is personal responsibility, especially in the realm of such influence. We all want to influence certain things, express belief in certain things and gravitate to certain things, so each to his own.
