The Independent Examinations Board's  2018 pass rate is 98.92% - a slight increase on last year’s pass rate of 98.76%. A total of 11 514 full-time and 858 part-time candidates sat for the IEB examinations in 2018. All successful IEB candidates achieved a pass that will allow them to enrol at tertiary institutions at one of the three levels: * 90.65% of the cohort achieved entry to degree study (compared to 88.50% in 2017) * 7.33% qualified for entry to diploma study (compared to 8.95% in 2017) * 0.95% achieved entry for study at the Higher Certificate level (compared to 1.30% in 2017) According to the IEB, the increase in the percentage pass rate for entry to bachelor degree studies can be attributed to the removal of the list of designated subjects. Previously in addition to the normal pass requirements for the NSC, the attainment of 50% or more in a minimum of 4 designated subjects was required for entry to degree study. In 2018, the list of designated subjects was removed. Learners must still get 50% in a minimum of 4 subjects. However, the 50% requirement can apply to any subject excluding Life Orientation. These students have made the IEB list for outstanding achievement: .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg .tg-1wig{font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-fymr{font-weight:bold;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top}  These students have made the IEB list for commendable achievement: .tg {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;} .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;} .tg .tg-1wig{font-weight:bold;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-fymr{font-weight:bold;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top} .tg .tg-0lax{text-align:left;vertical-align:top} The closing date for the application for re-marking is 10 January 2019 and the results from re-marking will be released on 6 February 2019.
