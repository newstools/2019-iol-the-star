“She is gone and no one and nothing is going to bring her back. I’ve stopped wasting my energy on something I can’t control. It’s time to let bygones be bygones,” Lekotje said. A close friend of the family, 57-year-old Mbali Khoza, said rumours of Mabaso’s death started circulating in the area last Friday. She believes he is not dead and that “there is a bigger force operating”. “It really sickens me. I don’t want to lie. How and why was he held in Cape Town when this crime occurred in Vlakfontein - because Khupe’s family is there?” Gauteng MEC of Safety and Community Sizakele Nkosi Malobane expressed her disappointment at the turn of events.
