 According to Ramaphosa, the lekgotla had focused on priorities for the implementation of the ANC manifesto and called for a focus on growing an inclusive economy and the building of state capacity. Several ANC leaders, Cosatu and the SACP have however pointed out that Magashule's utterances on the Sarb’s mandate were in line with the ANC's manifesto. In its manifesto the ANC stated: “The ANC believes that the South African Reserve Bank must pursue a flexible monetary policy, aligned with the objectives of the second phase of transition. "Without sacrificing price stability, monetary policy must take into account other objectives such as employment creation and economic growth.” The SACP said: ”It is important for the ANC, and of course the alliance as a whole, to remain true to history and loyal to the commitments we have made to our people.” Political Bureau
