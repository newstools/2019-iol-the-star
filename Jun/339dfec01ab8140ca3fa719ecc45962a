Johannesburg - Police have launched a manhunt for gunmen who shot and wounded three people in a robbery near the Bara Taxi Rank on Monday. The gunmen opened fire on a SBV security van, while the guards were loading cash into an ATM. The robbers started shooting randomly, wounding three bystanders. The spokesperson for the national commissioner of police, Colonel Athlenda Mathe, said a passer-by was shot in the ankle, another in the thigh and the third was grazed by a bullet. All the victims were admitted to the Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital. “An undisclosed amount of cash was taken and there have been no arrests,” Mathe said. The incident has left the community of Diepkloof shocked. Mathe said they had mobilised resources, which included crime intelligent officers and members of the tactical team to track down the suspects, after they fled the scene. Later that evening, two guards were shot and wounded in another cash in transit heist in Krugersdorp. ER24's Werner Vermaak said they arrived at the scene shortly after 18.30 and found the cash-in-transit vehicle halfway onto a pavement outside the Krugersdorp Police Station. "Upon assessment, paramedics found the passenger inside of the vehicle with a gunshot wound to his arm. He was treated on the scene and later transported to a nearby hospital for further medical care by ER24 and GPG. The driver of the vehicle was found inside of the police station. He had no visible injuries but were later transported to a nearby hospital by another service for a medical assessment. "The exact circumstances surrounding the incident is not yet known. However, it is understood that the incident took place along another route and the driver of the vehicle managed to make it to the police station in Krugersdorp while being chased," he said. The Star
