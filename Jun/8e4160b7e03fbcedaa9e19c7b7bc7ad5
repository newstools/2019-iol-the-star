Someone said they got 9k from FNB and theyâ€™ve already spent it all pic.twitter.com/mSs8hDWBnn   FNB adjusted peoples money in error. They reverse this error then charge for the reversal of their own error. Now to "correct" the error of the error, the victim must contact the perp at their own cost. You can't make this shit upðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚   So FNB is trying to reverse the money they paid to my account. My Account: pic.twitter.com/2j6YWAaYli   This is not the first time this FNB thing is happening. My mom says it once happened with the Department of Education employees that got payed through FNB. Instead of 24K, people got 240K salaries. Abantu benza imisebenzi, bought cars, renovated houses etc.   Iâ€™m not spending this money till FNB says whatâ€™s going on.   So FNB came back looking for their money and it wasnâ€™t there. Iâ€™m closing this account tomorrow pic.twitter.com/bQnXn0RuQp   So FNB decided to bless me me with R176k @FNBSA what am I supposed to do with it, I don't want to get arrested pic.twitter.com/99XwELlKZg
