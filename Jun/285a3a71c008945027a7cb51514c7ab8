Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba was expected to visit Alexandra township on Monday afternoon on a fact finding mission following the demolition of 80 houses last week. Allegations are that the demolitions were done without the correct procedure having been followed. Many families were left homeless and out in the cold this past weekend after the Red Ants descended into the area and demolished what was believed to have been illegally built structures. "The intent of this community engagement is to establish the facts after having met with the Johannesburg Metro Police Department," a statement from his office said. The statement also said Mashaba was committed to his promise of a responsive, accountable and transparent government and that the engagement with Alexandra residents was one of the ways he continues to serve residents of the City of Joburg. Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements MEC Lebogang Maile visited the area over the weekend and slammed the demolitions, labelling them reckless. “Yes, we will demolish, but not in an inhumane manner like we have seen here. When we move people we will tell them where we are moving them, and we’ll have a process to explain how we are moving them,” he said. Maile said officials from his office would work with the city council to ensure that a solution was found.
