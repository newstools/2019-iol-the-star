This followed the 84 buildings being awarded to developers across the inner city, which was expected to generate R21-billion in investment, 11000 construction jobs, and 6000 affordable housing units, said Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba. A further 70 buildings would be awarded by September, which would yield another expected R15bn in investment, 10000 jobs, and 5000 more housing opportunities. These properties all formed part of the 500 buildings identified for expropriation in the inner city. “The multiparty government has now identified 37 abandoned factories across the city, specifically those located in areas in desperate need of housing opportunities. Arising from their large-stand sizes, the yield of these properties will offer nearly 3000 housing opportunities in multi-storey buildings,” Mashaba said. The factories identified were in areas such as Kew, Devland, Rabie Ridge, Doornfontein, Booysens and Nancefield. Of particular interest were 16 factories close to Alexandra, offering the much-needed opportunity to reduce the density of settlement in the under-developed township. -  Africa News Agency (ANA)
