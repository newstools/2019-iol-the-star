It doesn't rain but pour at the embattled state owned entity Denel and this time staff will only get 85% of their salaries due to ongoing financial problems. On the eve of pay day, the entity sent a letter to employees telling them that the company was not in a position to pay them full salaries for June. “Due to the ongoing liquidity challenges, we are now faced with the unfortunate reality that the company is not in a position to fulfill the 100% salary obligation for June 2019,” said the entity's Group CEO Daniel du Toit in a signed letter. "Regrettably, employees will receive 85% of the salary obligation for June 2019. Please be assured that we as management are working tirelessy to ensure that the delayed portion of the salaries will be reimbursed as soon as possible," the letter continued. Botha said in view of the current challenging economic climate, it was "very traumatic" for employees to be uncertain whether they will actually receive their salaries the next month. “The impact on employees and their families is a big concern and leads to unnecessary pressure and stress,” Both said.   “We request Denel to be more cautious with the communication of sensitive information which has a direct impact on the lives of their employees,” he said. In March this year,  former Denel CEO Riaz Saloojee told the Zondo commission that he was fired over his refusal to cooperate with the Guptas and their desire to capture Denel. It was also reported last year that Denel suffered a net loss of R1.8bn in the 2017/18 financial year due to a significant decline in revenue from R8bn the previous year to R5bn. The Star
