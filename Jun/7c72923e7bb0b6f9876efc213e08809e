The 20-year-old Forest High School pupil alleged to have stabbed a fellow pupil to death and injuring two others was expected to appear at the Johannesburg Magistrate Court on Wednesday morning. The Grade 11 pupil faces two charges of attempted murder and one of murder. The fatal incident, which is said to be gang related, took place outside the school's premises on Monday morning after the first exam session. It is believed that the brawl was due to an ongoing feud between two dominant rival gangs, South Top Kids and Italian Destruction Vele. Pupils at the school alleged that the gang members were operating in and outside of the school. After the stabbings and the killing, MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school. Police who were looking for the suspect after the incident highlighted that the pupil had given the school an incorrect address which made it difficult for them to locate him at first. The culprit, who is now in custody, was later found in Dobsonville, Soweto. Schooling was canceled by the department after the murder while exams were also put on hold. The two injured school boys have since been discharged from hospital. The family of Daniel Bakwela, who was stabbed to death, told The Star that they were still organizing funeral arrangements which were proving to be a bit difficult especially because they were foreign nationals.
