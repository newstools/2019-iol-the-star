Johannesburg - Parents of the children caught on camera being assaulted  by a caretaker at Carletonville creche said they were disappointed by the justice system. They were speaking at the Oberholzer Magistrate's Court on Friday where Nellie Senwametsi faces a charge of assault after videos of her viciously assaulting children at Ninnie's Neuron's Nursery went viral on social media. The parents' displeasure comes from having to wait for some time as proceedings were prolonged because the court had to wait for the senior public prosecutor to bring the docket. A grandmother of one the abused toddlers said they were still having difficulties opening a police case. "This is really upsetting. We are taken from post to pillar while the perpetrator is roaming free. To make things worse, it's obviously going to be a postponement ," she said. This is Senwametsi's third appearance. The 40 year old woman was accompanied by a gentleman and a young girl to court. Vincentia Dlamini of Women and Men Against Child abuse also said the justice system was not treating the case as a priority. The Star
