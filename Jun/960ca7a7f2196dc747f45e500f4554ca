Johannesburg - Angry parents beat the woman was caught on camera assaulting their children as soon as she left court on Friday. Ironically, one of the parents struck Nellie Senwametsi with a scrubbing brush, the same weapon she was seen on camera using to beat one of the three toddlers she was seen abusing at Ninnie's Neuron's Nursery where she used to work. The enraged parents pounced on her as soon as she walked out of Obelhozer Carletonville Magistrate Court. They punched her in the face, slapped and pulled by her hair as she tried to get into a getaway car.     Senwametsi had arrived in court with a man who, however, did not defend her from the attacks. Police had to rescue her from the angry parents whose rage was also fueled by the third postponement of her case. The parents' anger and disappointment was obvious from the sighs that filled the gallery on the court room when the magistrate announced that the case was postponed to next month. With the police having finally rescued her,  Senwametsi left in the car driven by the same man who did not assist her as she was being attacked. The Star
