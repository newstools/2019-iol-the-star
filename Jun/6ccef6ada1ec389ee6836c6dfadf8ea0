Sagren Pillay, a concerned resident, says nothing is being done. “Allowing this property to get to this condition is disgusting and a waste of taxpayers money. “If the DA can manage to somehow keep Cape Town at a superior level to most cities in South Africa, why are they allowing Joburg to crumble further into dust? A point of no return a no confidence in DA leadership and future,” he said. “We daily witness people just walking into the property and removing the roof, beams and anything else they can lay their hands on. It will soon be occupied by homeless people. “It is being done openly and security staff on the property just sit back and watch. This means the devaluation of all the properties and businesses around it,” he added. The JDA did not reply to questions from Metrowatch. However, in correspondence with Pillay, an official confirmed it had been reported that the building was being stripped and no longer had a roof. “The allegation is the security company is stripping the property or allowing recyclers to do so,” the official said, adding the issue has been escalated.
