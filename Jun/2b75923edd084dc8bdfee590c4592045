Philiso, who has been with the public broadcaster for 24 years, where she has worked in different capacities. She will serve her notice until the end of the month. She has worked as general manager for sales operations, group executive for commercial enterprise and television, as well as acting group chief executive officer. Philiso’s departure follows the dismissal of chief operations officer Chris Maroleng in April. Earlier this year, it was reported that Philiso was accused of allegedly misleading the board during her tenure as acting group chief executive in a procurement matter. It was alleged she submitted a request for approval to conclude a contract between the SABC and a private company for the completion of the broadcaster’s website. It was alleged that she failed to disclose to the board that the National Treasury had dismissed her request for deviation and had also advised her and the SABC to consider going to a closed tender. Philiso said: “My tenure at the SABC has had more fulfilling moments. I learnt a lot and enjoyed the challenges immensely. As a true broadcaster, I look forward to cheering the team on as they deliver the much anticipated turnaround.”
