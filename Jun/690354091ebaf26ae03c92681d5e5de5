The South Gauteng High Court on Monday rejected the appeal by Thulani Madide and his brother Xolani, stating that their plea would not hold water. The duo were given life sentences last month for the murder of Thulaniâ€™s sisters-in-law Alice Madide and Wickey Mtshali, and the attempted murder of a child. They appealed their sentences as they felt the case had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. In a brief appearance, Judge Majake Mabesele recounted the murders of the sisters and the greedy motives for the murder plot. The assassination plot was to gain the taxi business run by Kelly Madide, Alice's husband. Last month, Judge Mabesele sentenced Thulani Madide to two life sentences, while his brother got one life sentence. In 2015, the brothers, along with hired hitman Sicelo Ndebele, hatched a plot to have Alice killed. Alice and Mtshali were shot with semi-automatic rifles while driving with Alice's young child in a car. The child was injured. Ndebele was sentenced to life in March last year. He turned State witness and accused Mbangiseni Madide, another brother, of pulling the trigger. Mbangiseni was acquitted. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said the NPA welcomed the court's decision that there were no reasonable prospects of success on appeal.
