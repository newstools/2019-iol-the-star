 Dear Apartheid Apologists, your time is over. You will not rule again. We do not fear you. Finally #TheLandIsOurs   Dear #ZindziMandela & black South Africans. I don't see why lashing out at your white counterparts on twitter will help get rid of inequality in SA. Do y'all know y'all can get land without all this divisive drama? White people are South Africans too. Despite a bitter past.   That Mandela woman is obviously being paid very well by someone! Havenâ€™t heard a peep from her since the squabbling over Madibaâ€™s Estate. Her money is probably up by now. #ZindziMandela   This is sad. It takes us backwards. So many ordinary South Africans here at home are trying to build bridges & unite our nation - whilst a whole SA Ambassador uses their paid position to divide the very country they are paid to represent. #ZindziMandela https://t.co/ZWAn5IyvSE  Funny how the minority finds this tweet as an embarrassment while they're raising unapologetic racists behind warm homes. We shall never forget how they got where they are. #ZindziMandela pic.twitter.com/mwlutOhSha  #ZindziMandela I understand her outrage. During apartheid she was robbed 27years of her life without her father. Her mother was constantly been dragged away from their home from racist cops because Winnie fought for what she believed in. The fire of the memories still burns!  Here's one thing i'm learning from this, most white people do not like us and most of them are ignorant or unaware of our plight and struggles as black people. They are all for the 'rainbow nation' just as long as we remain their surbodinates #ZindziMandela   And for those who think Zinzi is an embarrassmet, please take note that Madibaâ€™s dream for for SA to be a united rainbow nation but the truth is, it was JUST A DREAM. It never materialized even when he was alive and that was never because of the lack of effort from #ZindziMandela   All of a sudden the same people now want to be called AfricansðŸ™„ #ZindziMandela pic.twitter.com/R3jlzvGg9y   A fearless Queen who's been telling the truth and shaking the tables, continues to shake the tables, leaving the comfortable uncomfortable and the entitled privileged ones intimidated. I stan a fearless Queen! âœŠðŸ”¥#ZindziMandela pic.twitter.com/fPqZQjbGrv
