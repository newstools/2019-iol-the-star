A taxi driver was shot multiple times as he sat in the driver's seat of his vehicle while the body of his companion was found a few meters away on President Street, Germiston, on Wednesday morning. ER24' s Russel Meiring said they arrived at the scene around 6.40am and found a light motor vehicle parked on the pavement. Paramedics found one man with multiple gunshot wounds slumped behind the steering wheel while the second victim was found about 500 metres further up the road with a gunshot wound on his head. “Unfortunately, both men had already succumbed to their injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead,” Meiring added. Ekurhuleni West Cluster police spokesperson Constable Maxwell Mabunda said the motive behind the shooting had not yet been established. He added that police were collecting available information regarding the attack and it has been established that one of the victims was a taxi owner. “We don't know the motive for the shooting, but we are aware that the victim that was driving the vehicle was a taxi owner and we do not know who the other victim was,” Mabunda said. Mabunda added that the two victims were travelling in a Grey Mazda 3. Police urged community members with positive information to contact their nearest police station or the Crime Stop Line 08600 10111. The Star
