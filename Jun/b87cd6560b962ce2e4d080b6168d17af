Emmanuel Tshabalala, 51, was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment which was wholly suspended for five years by the Lenasia Regional Court on Tuesday, meaning he would not do time in jail. According to a National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) statement, Tshabalala pleaded guilty and entered into a plea and sentence agreement with the State. In the social worker's report that had been presented to court, it was stated that imprisoning Tshabalala would be futile as he was already living with the trauma and guilt of killing his own child. While the prosecutor had argued that releasing Tshabalala would send the wrong message to the community, the magistrate, Maggie van der Merwe disagreed. She said she saw just how remorseful Tshabalala was and that she could state as a fact that he would be burdened by guilt and regret for the rest of his life. Luyanda Themba Tshabalala, 16, was accidentally shot by his father at the Fred Norman High School in Ennerdale last year. Tshabalala took his son to extra lessons and when he came back to collect him he fell asleep and was woken by a noise. Thinking he was being hijacked, Tshabalala opened fire. “I withdrew my licensed firearm and shot once,” he said in an affidavit. “After firing the shot, I realised it was my son when I heard a voice saying: ‘Daddy, it’s me’
