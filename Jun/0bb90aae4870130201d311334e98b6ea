Johannesburg - The Alexandra community burnt to death a man they believed was a serial rapist who had been terrorising them. As the man was being attacked, other people took a video of the incident which later went viral on social media. The angry community had accused the unknown man of rape, armed robbery and theft in the area before assaulting, stoning and burning him. The video of the gruesome incident shows the community standing near a raging fire in which the silhouette of a person can clearlybe seen in the middle of the blaze. None of the people in the video are identifiable as the video was taken at night. Gauteng police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed the incident. “Yesterday (Monday) around 5pm police responded to the complaint of mob justice on 3rd Avenue in Alexandra. "When they arrived there was nothing they could do as the person was already dead. It is unclear why the victim was stoned and torched, but allegations are that he has been raping and robbing women in the area,” Dlamini said. Dlamini said police were investigating a case of murder and no one has been arrested. The Star
