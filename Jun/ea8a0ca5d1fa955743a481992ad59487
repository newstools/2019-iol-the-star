The institution halted students from training following the attacks. UFS management said a meeting with the department of health, hospital management and the police was held on Monday to iron out security issues at Pelonomi. “The department provided the university with an emergency security plan comprising immediate and medium-term interventions.” A new security plan include the installation of high-mast lights in the hospital precinct, repairing of a perimeter fence and limiting access to the hospital after 8pm. A centre consisting of the police, security guards will also be established at the hospital. Security lapses at the hospital came under the spotlight after a 24-year-old female doctor fought off a man and bit off his tongue when he tried to rape her at the hospital. A few days later, another doctor was held at gunpoint and robbed of her cellphone.
