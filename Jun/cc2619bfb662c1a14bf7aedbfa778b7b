Johannesburg - Musician Nhlanhla Nciza of the group Mafikizolo, took to Instagram on Thursday morning to announce that she and her husband of 15 years - Thembinkosi "TK" Nciza - were ending their marriage. In the heartfelt post she wrote: “After almost 15 years of our strong bond of marriage, my husband TK Nciza and I have come to a tough but amicable decision to bring an end to our union. I am thankful for the support we have given each other over the years while raising our children,” “We shall remain on good terms and continue our endeavor to be great and exemplary parents to our children,” She added that she they appreciated the support they received from family and friends would like to appeal for privacy, particularly for the sake of their children. In 2002, Nciza was pregnant with twins when she was involved in a car crash that claimed one of the children. The surviving twin, Zinathi, was killed in a car crash shortly before Christmas in 2009 when TK’s mom - who was driving with the little girl in her car- crashed into a tree. The Star
