Ekurhuleni - Three suspects aged between 29 and 46 were nabbed after they were filmed while robbing a 52-year-old man who was withdrawing money in Thokoza. According to Thokoza police spokesperson Constable Sivenkosi Mtwa, it is alleged that the suspects would act as if they are withdrawing money and then would pretend to be assisting their victims once they have tampered with the ATM. “They would let you withdraw money while they are watching the victim type in their ATM PIN, after the victim has withdrawn. The suspects would insert their own fraudulent cards in the ATM to withdraw the victim’s money using the same ATM PIN,” Mtwa said. Mtwa added that after a successful transaction, the trio will get in a motor vehicle, drive off and return in different outfits, making it hard to be identified by victims. Mtwa said after complaints about the trio, two undercover police officers were deployed at the suspects’ hunting ground and they were caught in action while attempting to rob a 52-year-old suspect who was withdrawing at one of the ATMs in the area. “The suspects were caught with various bank cards as well as a large amount of money estimated to be R15 000,” he added. Mtwa said the suspects were arrested and detained at Thokoza police station facing fraud charges. He added that more charges might be added when police investigations continues, and suspects were expected to appear before the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court soon.
