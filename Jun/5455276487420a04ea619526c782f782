There were tears of unhappiness at the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court when the Forest High School pupil accused of murdering a fellow pupil was granted bail. Monda Muhammed Mowela, 19, was granted a R5 000 bail and ordered not to enter Forest High or Turfontein until the trial is finalised. Mowela was arrested last week and charged with murder after allegedly stabbing Daniel Bakwela to death as well as two counts of attempted murder for allegedly stabbing and injuring two others schoolboys. Speaking in court before proceedings, Mowela's sister said her brother was just defending himself. "It has been so stressful and we have just decided to leave everything in God's hands. We want the media to stop spreading incorrect stories. He was just defending himself," she said. Mowela was busy with exams at the time of the stabbing and it's not yet known what arrangementÂ  has been made to ensure that he finished them. The matter has been postponed to next month. The Star
