A Johannesburg prosecutor was arrested after he allegedly asked for a R10 000 bribe to squash a case. According to Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo, the 44-year-old  prosecutor from the Johannesburg Family Court was arrested on Tuesday in possession of R5000 he was allegedly given by the victim. “The victim alleged that he received a call  from a man who identified himself as the prosecutor who dealt with his case in court. "The caller informed him that if he gave him R10 000 he will cancel his case, give him the docket and ensure that no case will be opened against him again,” Masondo said. After the matter was reported to the Anti-Corruption Unit, an operation was initiated, Masondo added. Masondo said the suspect was arrested at the Johannesburg Family court on Tuesday with R5000 he was given by the victim which was half of what he had requested. He added that the suspect was arrested in possession of the money and was expected to appear at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court for corruption and extortion on June 27. The Star
