Johannesburg - Some parts of Ekurhuleni have been without power for the past five days after cable theft and a subsequent explosion at a substation plunged the area into darkness in the early hours of Saturday morning. The city has also spent R10-million in the past few days hoping to restore power, but it has been unable to do so due to the extensive damage the fire caused. Themba Gadebe, the municipality spokesperson, said the cables were stolen in the early hours of Saturday morning. He said the theft of the cables resulted in the Glen Marais substation exploding and then engulfed in a raging inferno. The substation, he said, supplies power to several areas in Kempton Park. "Due to the fire, we first had to deal with the disaster management side of things before assessing the damage. We spent R10-million replacing panels and our targeted time for restoring power was Tuesday. However, before the switch on, we need to do tests. Due to the extent of the fire and too much carbon dioxide, we could not switch on power as the panels failed. We worked on the power station throughout Tuesday night and we hope we will restore some power by Wednesday afternoon and that all the areas will be switched on by Thursday. Cable theft is a problem that the whole of South Africa is battling with," he said. Radebe said this was the longest that parts of the municipality have gone without power . The Star
