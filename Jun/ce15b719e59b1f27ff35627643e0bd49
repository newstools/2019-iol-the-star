Mculo, with Heavy K, opened more doors for her and she has since put her vocals on the popular hit, Gugulethu, with Prince Kaybee, Supta and the Afro Boys, and My Dali with TNS. Her solo debut single L.O.V.E. is available on streaming channels. She spoke to The Star about her favourite trends in tech:  Which network provider do you think needs to improve its services?
