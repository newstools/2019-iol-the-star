Johannesburg - Joburg MMC for health and social development, Dr Mpho Phalatse was on Wednesday expected to visit the Westdene preschool where two children died due to rat poisoning. Phalatse's spokesperson, Siyanda Makhubu said the deaths were reported about a week ago and the Environmental Health team was dispatched to the preschool after the incident. It was noted upon investigations that the facility was non-compliant. It is alleged that the two children were under the care and supervision of an illegal privately-owned preschool. Makhubu said the facility, which had accommodated 10 children, was closed down after it was established that it did not comply with the City’s by-laws, adding that the area was said to be infested with preschools operating illegally. “The MMC is expected to visit the family of the victims on Wednesday afternoon, and during the visit she will also visit the preschool where the incident occurred and the Sophiatown police station,” Makhubu said. Phalatse will be accompanied by the City of Johannesburg officials in the Social Development, including social workers, the City’s child desk, environmental health officials, the Emergency Management Services and local ward councillors. Sophiatown police spokesperson, Captain Jerbes De Bruyn said an inquest case was opened for investigations. The Star
