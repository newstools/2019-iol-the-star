The woman caught on camera viciously beating toddlers she was in charge of at a Carletonville creche was expected back in court on Friday. Nellie Senwametsi, 40, will be at the Oberholzer Magistrate's Court to face a charge of assault. However, some people such as the Women and Men against Child Abuse (WMACA) are not happy that its only Senwametsi who is appearing in court for the abuse of the children while the lady who recorded the videos at Ninnie's Neuron's Nursery  and did nothing to help the children was yet to be found and also prosecuted. “The case is not at the trial stage yet, we are still waiting to find out what will happen to the woman who took the videos," said  WMACA's Founding Director, Miranda Jordan. The organisation also represents the parents of the children. While the videos of the gruesome assaults were recorded last year, they only came to light this year and led to an uproar. As soon as they were circulated on social media, parents rushed to the creche to remove their children. Investigations by Gauteng Social Development also revealed that the ceche was operating illegally and it was immediately shut down. The Star
