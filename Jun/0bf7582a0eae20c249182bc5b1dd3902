Johannesburg - "Truth be told, our parents have failed us". This was the claim made by the president of the Forest High School Representative of Learners Council, Nobuhle Mashinini, who spoke at the memorial service of her fellow schoolmate Daniel Bakwela on Tuesday. Bakwela was stabbed to death during a suspected gang-related brawl at the school last week and two other pupils were injured. The suspect, Mohamed Mwela - who is also a pupil at the school - faces a charge of murder as well as two charges of attempted murder. He was released on a R5 000 bail on Monday at the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court. Speaking at the memorial service that was attended by among others, Gauteng's Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, Mashinini pointed fingers at the parents for not doing enough to ensure that incidents such as the one that happened at her school don't happen. "It is very disappointing to be speaking here today. What are our parents doing? They are quick to blame the teachers and principal when such incidents happen. Truth be told, our parents have failed us, "she said. Bakwela's distraught family was also in attendance. A Grade 12 pupil said since the incident occurred, the department offered counseling and support services to anyone who needed it at the school. The Star
