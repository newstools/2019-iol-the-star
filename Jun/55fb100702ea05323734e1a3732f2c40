South African dance sensation Oscar Buthelezi walked away with three awards at an international competition for choreographers in Germany which featured 19 top finalists from across the world. Buthelezi bagged three awards including the main one for his dance piece ‘The Road’  at the 33rd International Competition for Choreographers in Hanover, Germany on June 22. Buthelezi won the Residency (scholarship) in Australia Dance Company; the Audience Choice; and the Jury Award which was the main one. Buthelzi took to Facebook to announce his achievement and thanked the people who assisted him to fund raise to attend the awards. “Thank you Yvette Nowell #RMB for your support, #mama Robyn Orlin for your positive energy and commitment connecting with the competition, and especially Lisa Sharon Loeb and Eugenie Drakes for setting up the crowd funding,to the German Embassy and Goethe Institute Germany 🇩🇪 and Birgit Grüßer and Helmut Jochheim,” said Buthelezi. “I’m still a bit speechless but let South Africa be on the map… so humbled”. Gauteng MEC for Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation Mbali Hlophe congratulated Buthelezi for his exploits and wished for her career to be bigger and brighter. “South Africa will have to get used to the name Oscar Buthelezi. The talent in him is amazing and no wonder he’s taking the world by storm in performance arts. Congratulations to him and his team for putting South Africa on the map,” said Hlophe. “A product of our dance programme Gauteng Motjeko Dance, he continues to make us proud as Gauteng for having helped found his success. We are glad to have been there when his passion was ignited, which is what we want to do for every young person within the spaces we operate -the arts and sport.” Buthelezi, who earned international acclaim for his “bold choreography and the brilliant style and sensitivity of his dance", is six-time and only winner of the acclaimed Kurt Jooss Choreography Awards held in Germany every three years.
