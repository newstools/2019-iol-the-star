The body of a toddler who had been reported missing was found inside a disused freezer at a neighbour’s house in Thabong, Free State on Thursday morning. His mother, Nthabiseng Molete, 23, had last seen him playing on Wednesday afternoon. According to Thabong police spokesperson Sergeant Mamello Mokhuoane, a search was initiated soon after his mother reported him missing. Mokhuoane said the following day, one of the neighbours who was assisting with the search looked in one of the outside buildings used as a church in her yard and found the body of the boy in a deep freezer. The refrigerator was not working at the time. Mokhuoane said it was hard to determine what could have transpired leading to the death of the boy. “We are waiting for the post-mortem results to help us determine what happened and to establish if the child sustained any injuries or was sexually assaulted before he died,” Mukhuoane added. She added that an inquest docket was registered with the police and investigations were continuing. The Star
