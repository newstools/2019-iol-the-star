The NPA has refused to be drawn, saying it was “a confidential issue” which it would not comment on. AfriForum’s prosecution unit represents Gabriella Engels, a Joburg model who claims she was assaulted with an extension cord by Mugabe at a luxury Sandton hotel in 2017. “We hope that the prosecution of Grace Mugabe will commence shortly and we will monitor the case,” Afri- Forum said in a statement. “AfriForum gets involved in issues like this to ensure that people with political power do not get away with committing crimes. Grace Mugabe must be brought to book for her deeds, and this is the first step in ensuring that Miss Engels will get justice soon.” AfriForum and Engels last year won a court bid overturning a decision by the South African government granting Mugabe diplomatic immunity.
