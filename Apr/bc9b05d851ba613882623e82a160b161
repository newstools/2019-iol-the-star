Johannesburg - An illegal miner's legs were amputated in a freak accident when he fell into a hole he was digging and a machine severed them. The incident happened in City Deep om Sunday morning. According to ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell, the 35 year old man and his fellow miner were busy digging a hole with heavy machinery when the victim lost his balance and fell inside the hole. “The digger continued, amputating both legs in the process. One was amputated below the knee and the other just above the knee,” Campbell said. Paramedics arrived at the scene to find the man still inside the hole. Campbell said paramedics used a scoop to extract the man before tourniquets were applied to both limbs. A tourniquet is a device used to reduce blood flow from a wound. He was then taken to Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital for emergency treatment. The hospital's communications officer, Nkosiyethu Mazibuko, confirmed that the patient was admitted at the hospital on Sunday. Mazibuko could not give information regarding the condition of the patient, but confirmed that he was brought in for amputation.
