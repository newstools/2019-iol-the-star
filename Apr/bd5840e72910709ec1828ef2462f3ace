Soweto - Two buses were torched when Mzimhlophe Hostel residents in Soweto went on a rampage on Tuesday evening over regular power outages and lack of services. According to Captain Hitler Ngwenya from Soweto East Cluster, the hostel dwellers had blocked the Soweto Highway (M70) with burning tyres,  protesting over regular power outages they experience as well as lack of services. While blocking roads with burning tyres, two buses traveling along the road near the hostel were set alight. The buses had passengers inside. “Police are investigating a case of malicious damage to property and illegal protest,” Ngwenya added. Witness Mhlongo from Putco Bus Company confirmed that the two buses were theirs and that no passenger was injured. "The buses that were burnt belong to Putco and none of the passengers were injured during the fire," Mhlongo said.  Ngwenya confirmed that no one has been arrested and that police were working around the clock to bring the perpetrators to book. The Star
