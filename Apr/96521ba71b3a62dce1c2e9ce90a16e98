Johannesburg - Police had to fire rubber bullets at hundreds of protesting Bekkersdal informal settlementÂ residents to prevent them from marching to their local municipality offices. The furious residents wanted to march to the Westonaria Local Municipality when the rubber bullets stopped them in their tracks. They said they were fed up with the lack of consideration by the government and it was high time someone gave them answered. All they wanted, they said, was to voice their plight.     "For years we have been promised electricity and this has still not materialised. Budget had been allocated and yet people are looting. We want the councilor to answer," said Mpho Makgetla, one of the residents. Some children did not go to school and were part of the strike. The residents brought the informal settlement to a standstill and said they had sent their counterparts to the police station to cause a stir. About 15 police vehicles were on stand by to control the livid protesters. The Star
