Johannesburg - The DA made their objection to some of the names on the ANC in a dramatic fashion: by dumping a bunch of orange overalls and handcuffs at the ruling party's headquarters. According to the DA, the orange overalls and the handcuffs are for the ANC candidates who “should be in jail no parliament”. Those, they said, include the president himself Cyril Ramaphosa as well as members such as Zizi Kodwa, Collen Maine, Malusi Gigaba and Bathabile Dlamini. The items were delivered by DA’s Gauteng Premier candidate Solly Msimanga who was accompanied by John Moody a well as Makashule Gana. They descended on Luthuli House on Wednesday morning where they dumped the overalls and handcuff and left. The ANC, however, condemned the action by the opposition and called it "a desperate move to win elections". Spokesperson Dakota Legoete regarded the DA’s stance as political immaturity and extreme provocation as well as interfering with the rights to campaign. Legoete said they asked the DA not to come closer to their headquarters, adding that the ANC had the capacity to mesmerize them. “We had the capacity to mesmerize them, but we chose not to do it.” Legoete said with  smile. “We will make a formal application to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) about this interference with our rights,” he added. Legoete said the party would be accepting a memorandum from the DA later during the day.
