“Matjila appeared before the Mokopane Regional Court for stealing the baby. Her first appearance was on April 15 when she was denied bail.” Manamela said Matjila’s case was heard on Tuesday and she was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. Matjila met the mother at Mokopane shopping centre last month and offered to hold the baby so that the mother could eat. They then went into a supermarket with Matjila still carrying the 6-week-old baby. She then disappeared with the infant without the mother noticing. Matjila and her boyfriend were arrested after they were found with the baby at Ga-Mphela village outside Polokwane. The baby was unharmed. - African News Agency (ANA)
