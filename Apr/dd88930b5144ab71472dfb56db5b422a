Johannesburg - Police have warned that they will not hesitate to arrest those who lie about being victims of crime as that leads to officers wasting police resources by investigating non-existent cases. Lieutenant Colonel Lungile Dlamini of the Gauteng Police said those making false crime claims were contributing to a perception that crime was out of control.. The warning comes after a 30 year old man was expected to appear in court for reporting a false hijacking case, describing how his vehicle was taken by suspects armed with a rifle. “The suspect has been arrested and will be charged with perjury when he appears at the Protea Magistrates Court today,” Dlamini said “As hijackings forms part of a serious and violent crimes, the Gauteng Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawila has tasked special  teams to investigate these cases,” he added Dlamini added that during the preliminary investigation, police found discrepancies in the victim’s report and on further questioning the victim, it was established that the report was false. “He had never been hijacked, instead he was panicking about the whereabouts of the vehicle. The false report was made three days after the vehicle was not in his possession,” Dlamini said “However motorists are warned to be always vigilant and should report all suspicious people and vehicles as most of the hijackings are committed at the robots, driveways and at remote parking spots,” he added
