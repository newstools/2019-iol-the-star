Johannesburg - The Zondo commission will this week shift its focus to state capture allegations at law enforcement agencies. This first witness expected on Monday morning is former Ipid boss Robert McBride. McBride was supposed to give evidence in February but his appearance was postponed. Evidence leader Advocate Paul Pretorius had said that McBride’s testimony will implicate about 30 people who hold high office in government. He is likely to focus on his challenging role as the head of IPID and attempts made to undermine the directorates work and functions. McBride’s contract as the head of IPID ended last month. He had been in a battle with police minister Bheki Cele over the renewal of his contract. Cele had made it clear that he will no renew McBride’s contract, but the former Ekurhuleni metro police chief was not happy and even threatened to go to court over the matter. McBride argued that it was not Cele who could make the decision whether to renew his contract or not and that only Parliament could do so. Parliament voted last month against the extension of his contract.

He had previously been suspended by former minister Nathi Nhleko and he had to claw back to his job through court action. Ipid also faced various opposition from police because of its mandate to investigate work done by police officers. Former acting commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane often was unhappy with the targeted work done by the unit. The commission resumes at 10am.
