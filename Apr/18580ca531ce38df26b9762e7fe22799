It is still beyond me, as someone who was part of his questioning, that he could smile and show no remorse throughout the interrogation. This is a boy who was part of the people who went out to look for the missing child, knowing very well that he was the guilty one. It is also disappointing to learn that both the victim and the perpetrator were among the top-performing pupils at their school. Truly the community has lost future movers and shakers of society. The bigger problem that we are facing as a country is that while we work with the girl-child, we must also do more on the boy-child. We ought to make them understand that love always conquers evil. If children love one another as brothers and sisters, they would avoid situations where they see themselves in bed with one another. Where there is love there will be no rape, murder, evil intentions, etc, because love will make us live in peace and harmony.
