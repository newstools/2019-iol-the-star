Mapaila said KZN, where the task team had been commended for arresting suspects in political killings, was not the only one facing the problem. However, he said KZN deserved to be prioritised because it had been the hardest hit by the political murders. “In Limpopo, for instance, comrades who were linked with exposing corruption in the VBS scandal have been killed. We want them to make intervention across the board as we have lost comrade Moss Phakoe in North West, and we lost comrade Bomba Ntshangase in Mpumalanga after we launched our mass campaign against corruption. “So we know what it means to lose our leading cadres in the fight against corruption. “That is why when action is being taken we feel encouraged,” he said.
