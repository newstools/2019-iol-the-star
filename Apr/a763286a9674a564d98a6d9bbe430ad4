Vanderbijlpark - Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi announced that the department will not oppose any legal action taken by the families of the victims of the Hoërskool Driehoek walkway collapse. Lesufi revealed this during the unveiling of the newly-built walkway at the Vanderbijlpark school on Tuesday. Four pupils were killed and about 20 others injured when the structure came crashing down in February while pupils were making their way to class. Lesufi said that he personally would not oppose any legal action. “I don’t want to oppose anything; I really feel that the lawyers must meet and find a solution and find the middle ground. I didn’t sit under the tree and said the structure must fall,” Lesufi said. However the department spokesperson Steve Mabona said: “We have not received any summons, we only gave access to the school to the Attorney who claimed to be representing some learners.” Lesufi added that he received separate commissioned reports prepared by the school, head of department and structural engineers. He said the three reports would be consolidated into one report before being made public.
