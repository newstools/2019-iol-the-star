On Sunday, photographer Bongani Mnguni died after complaining of chest pains, just a day after the industry lost Juby Mayet, an 80-year-old journalist. Mnguni, 65, took his last breath at his Horizon View home in Roodepoort. His wife Lucia said he complained of chest pains and died an hour later. “He had a beautiful heart and loved his family. He treated everyone like they were family.” Mayet, one of the giants of black journalism, died at her home in Lenasia on Saturday morning. The legendary writer and Struggle-era journalist succumbed to an undisclosed illness. Mnguni started his job in 1972 as a freelance photographer and later worked for Sowetan, City Press, Sunday World and other publications as a photographer. In the 1970s and 1980s Mnguni documented apartheid in Gauteng townships. He was one of the photographers who recorded the June 16, 1976 Soweto uprising through his lens. Freelance photographer Tladi Khuele said: “He was like a brother to me. I knew him from 1978 when I started doing photography. His passing came while we were working on a project of compiling photographs that we had from the 1990s to exhibit them. He had all the photographs from way back, including from June 16.” @yethudlamini
