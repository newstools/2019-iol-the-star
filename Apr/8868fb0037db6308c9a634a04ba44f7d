Johannesburg - Two suspects caught with stolen goods worth thousands of rands, precious metals and an unlicensed firearm were arrested this weekend for attempting to bribe police with R3000.  Police spokesperson, Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, said the two were among 16 other perpetrators who were arrested for possession of crayfish and 14 illegal firearms and ammunition in Ekurhuleni, West Rand, Sedibeng and Soweto in operations over the weekend. “Attempted acts of bribery happened when police acting on information raided premises at Railway street, Germiston,” said Dlamini. “While searching the premises where they seized suspected stolen boxes of cigarettes, a bag of precious metals, R100 000 in cash and unlicensed 9mm pistol, the occupants of the premises offered them a R3000 bribe.” The police refused the bribe and the suspects were arrested and charged with possession of suspected stolen goods, dealing in precious metals without any licence, the possession of an unlicensed firearm and bribery. Dlamini added that further investigation would be done to establish the legality of both suspects in the country. “The Gauteng Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela  has commended the members, who refused to take a bribe, for their commitment and integrity in rendering a responsible service to address criminality in Gauteng,” said Dlamini. The suspects were due to appear at the various courts in Gauteng on Monday. The Star
