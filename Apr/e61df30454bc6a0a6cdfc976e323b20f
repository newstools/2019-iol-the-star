Johannesburg - President Cyril Ramaphosa has lambasted his detractors in the African National Congress, saying those who are fighting back against him will never succeed. Ramaphosa made his remarks during a dialogue with community members in Sandton, Johannesburg on Thursday night. He said the governing party was on a renewal path. "The sense of renewal is gaining momentum. Things that happened in the past are going to be history... even those who are waging a fight-back are not going to succeed," he said to a round of applause. "They will not succeed because the majority of South Africans are sick and tired of the wrong things that happened. Those committed to doing wrong things are going to fail." He said the ongoing commissions of inquiry were "throwing everything out in the open" and some people could go to jail. "The Zondo commission is enabling us as a nation to see what was going on... and say to ourselves never again shall South Africa go through that. The commission's findings will be issued once the work is completed. "But while it's in session as it is, there are certain things coming out that are actionable. If there needs to be jail time... there must be jail time so that those who've done wrong against the State must be men and women themselves and go answer." The deeply divided and factionalised ANC is facing crucial national elections next month. The once dominant faction aligned to former president Jacob Zuma in the party is fighting for survival as Ramaphosa tries to crush rampant corruption and state capture. African News Agency/ANA
