He received a breather at the Johannesburg Special Commercial Crime Court on Tuesday as he was informed that his scheduled sentencing would not proceed. Busang was told that he would now be sentenced, and possibly jailed, on June 25. His sentencing did not proceed because it was part of the cases that would now sit at the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court. His R20000 bail was extended following his conviction earlier this year. Busang, a former Gautrain IT technician from Ga-Rankuwa, north of Pretoria, was found guilty of a count of fraud earlier in the year. He was arrested in 2014. The court hear that Busang hacked Gautrain's IT systems and allowed outsiders to access it in their failed bid to siphon off R800m from its account. Busang, who pleaded guilty, told the court that he committed the crime.
