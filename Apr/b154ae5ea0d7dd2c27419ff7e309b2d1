Objections may be lodged. Those who are considered to be unrehabilitated insolvents, declared of unsound mind by a court or convicted of an offence and sentenced to more than 12 months’ imprisonment without the option of a fine are disqualified. We have set our standards too low for an ideal public representative that can serve as a good role model. Almost all the 48 registered political parties have committed to combating crime, violence, brutality, rape, corruption, and woman and child abuse. We therefore need to raise the bar so that not just anyone can qualify. Electing a public representative who has any criminal record should be considered as sub-standard with respect to the requirements. The reason we recently witnessed violence in Parliament and some council meetings is because some of the charlatans are disguised as public representatives. Even if they’re involved in criminal activities such as destruction of property or assault, they get away with an insignificant docking of their salary and a brief suspension. The demands we place on our public representatives should be extended to community leaders.
