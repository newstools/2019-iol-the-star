Before the changes, parents and guardians could only apply to schools within a 5km radius to their home or work address. This is the first time that the new Admission Policy and Regulations is being applied since promulgation last year. Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said: “The post-apartheid state has made strides to build a unified, non-racial and non-sexist education system and to redistribute resources to ensure equitable access to quality education across the public-school system.” While parents can apply for schools over 30km radius, acceptance will be on a first come, first served basis, with preference given to those who live near the schools of choice. “Still, parents should understand that living closer to the school does not mean automatic admission. “Placement will depend on the time the application was made and availability of space. “We urge parents to apply on time to avoid frustration. “The system has improved efficiency, fairness and transparency and eliminated unacceptable practices.” The department also revealed that the capacity of the admission online system had been risen from 40 000 to 50 000 people at the same time. Applications for grades 1 and 8 open on May 13 at 8am and close on July 15 at midnight. Placement of learners takes place between August 27 and September 20.
