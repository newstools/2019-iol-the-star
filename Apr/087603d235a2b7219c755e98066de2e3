Johannesburg - South Africans travelling to different parts of the country this Easter may have to put their plans on hold if truck drivers carry on their threat of shutting down major national roads. It's believed that this intended shutdown was triggered by the employment of foreign truck drivers in the country, something they're not happy about. Transport minister Blade Nzimande has, however, called on authorities to arrest anyone planning to block the roads and also impound their vehicles. He said it was disingenuous and disturbing that after numerous meetings, which were followed by agreed recommendations between government and the truck drivers' associations, they were now finding out about the planned shutdown. Nzimande said any planned action to block roads would be a clear indication that the truck drivers' associations were engaging government in bad faith. "Blocking roads would not only disrupt the flow of traffic, but was tantamount to sabotaging the economy of the country, service delivery programmes and disrupting the Easter break of millions of South Africans," Nzimande said.
