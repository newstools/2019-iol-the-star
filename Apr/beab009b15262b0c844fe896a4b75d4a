Alexandra residents have been protesting over poor service delivery since last week. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane and the commission's chairperson Bongani Majola met on Tuesday and resolved to launch a joint investigation, with a view to finding lasting solutions to the grievances. “It is important for people to be aware that Chapter 9 of the Constitution establishes the Human Rights Commission and my office essentially for people to vindicate their rights on matters such as public service delivery,” Mkhwebane said. She said her office would tackle the maladministration aspects of the issues that appear to be troubling residents, including the allocation of resources towards the delivery of quality public services in the township. The commission would focus its end of the investigation on human rights issues such as access to housing, water and sanitation, education and healthcare, and that the environment was not harmful to the health and wellbeing of people, among other things. Mkhwebane said the investigation would cut across the different spheres of government, looking into the acts and omissions of national, provincial and local administrations. - African News Agency (ANA)
