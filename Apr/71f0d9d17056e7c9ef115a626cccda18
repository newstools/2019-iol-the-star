Johannesburg - Six suspects were expected to appear in the Alexandra Magistrate Court on Friday for allegedly planning an armed robbery that police later foiled. It's believed that they wanted to rob a restaurant in Illovo. Gauteng police spokesperson, Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed the arrest of six suspects aged between 22 and 37 and said police retrieved two unlicensed firearms. According to Makhubele suspects were arrested after police received information that they had consulted a sangoma before the commission of the crime. “Johannesburg Crime Intelligence, Flying Squad and Johannesburg Metro Police arrested six suspects for conspiracy to rob and recovered two unlicensed firearms at Illovo last night at about 20:45,” Makhubele said. “The suspects’ vehicle was spotted driving around Illovo, police stopped the vehicle and confronted the suspects. Upon searching the suspects, they were found in possession of two unlicensed firearms,” Makhubele added. He added that police also established that the suspects’ vehicle, a silver Audi had been reported stolen. He said it was stolen during a robbery in Roodepoort this month. The suspects are being profiled as they are suspected to have been involved in other serious and violent criminal activities. Gauteng Police management are urging members of the community to continue reporting crime by calling the Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or their nearest police stations.
