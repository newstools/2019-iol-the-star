The Bachelor of Law (LLB) programme at North West University (NWU) has finally received full accreditation. In 2017, the Council on Higher Education, which is responsible for quality assurance, issued notices of withdrawal of accreditation to the universities of Limpopo and Zululand. The accreditation of Walter Sisulu University, in the Eastern Cape, was withdrawn. NWU was one of 10 universities whose programme was hanging in the balance. This came after the council conducted a national review of the LLB programme at 17 institutions offering the programme in 2015 and 2016. The university said its submitted its progress report to the council in October. NWU vice-chancellor Dan Kgwadi said: “We had a dedicated team addressing the identified shortcomings, and all along I was confident that NWU will, through addressing the issues identified, ensure that we deliver an even better LLB degree, not only to the benefit of our students, but also that of the country.”
