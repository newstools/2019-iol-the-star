Two years after he was found guilty of a myriad of sex related charges including exposing his children to pornography, a former modelling boss was to finally be sentenced on Monday. The sentencing of Dawie De Villiers -founder of Modelling South Africa (PTY) - has been postponed several times mainly over the court  transcript that the defence needed to obtain before sentencing could proceed. He also remained out on bail after his conviction despite numerous unsuccessful attempts by prosecutor Arveena Persad to have his bail withdraw. De Villiers was charged with rape, sexual assault, indecent assault, sexual grooming, possession and accessing of child pornography, fraud, theft and unlawfully exposing his two children to pornography.  Allegations are that he committed the offences between 2008 and 2013. On the charges of rape and sexual assault, De Villiers sexually assaulted a 14 year old teenage girl in Rustenburg in 2011. In the same year, he raped a 15 year old girl in Kempton Park. The 11 fraud and theft charges involve thousands of Rands he allegedly took from people but did not deliver on his promises. Though he had denied all the allegations, he was found guilty of rape, sexual assault, sexual grooming, fraud, exposing children to pornography and accessing child pornography seven year later. The Kempton Park model agency boss maintained his innocence following his conviction and remained unremorseful. "Its difficult to show remorse to something I didn't do," he told the court.
