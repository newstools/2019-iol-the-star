The SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) wants the Gauteng Sport, Arts and Recreation MEC to explain her comments to senior department officials. In a leaked recording, Mazibuko was heard screaming at senior managers, informing them to roll out the combi-courts project without delay. Combi courts are facilities that cater for more than one sporting code, including netball, tennis, volleyball and basketball. Mazibuko wanted the senior managers to ensure the courts were erected in townships so she could use them to campaign for the elections. Mazibuko said: “I empower you, you are not empowerable. Which other department has an Indian that is a CFO? Which department has an HoD that is a mlungu (white person)? Ayikho (there is none), including national.” The clip went viral on social media and Mazibuko was forced to apologise. Now, the SAHRC will decide whether her apology was enough. She was on Tuesday expected to explain her words and actions to the SAHRC. The commission’s Buang Jones said: “The commission was of the view that it implicated a number of rights listed in the Bill of Rights. Following this, (it) initiated an investigation and consolidated all complaints from the public into one and proceeded to assess this matter.”
