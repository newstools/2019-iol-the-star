Johannesburg- The Carletonville crèche where a worker was filmed brutally assaulting children is no longer operating. This is exactly a week after Gauteng Social Development and MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza confirmed that her department had pulled the plug on the creche after assessing the premises and engaging parents of the minors who attended the crèche. According to her, the crèche only had a conditional certificate to operate until 2016. When The Star visited the creche on Thursday morning, the premises were completely abandoned. Gates were locked and windows shut. A handyman who works in the area confirmed that there had been no movement since Mayathula-Khoza's visit. "I've been working in this area for almost two years and I didn't know what was happening. But since the stories came out, no one has come to the premises," he said. Last week Thursday parents rushed to fetch their kids after footage of the caregiver who is now on bail went viral. The viral and graphic videos show the caregiver violently beating up three small children on separate occasions. She assaulted the children with open hands all over their little bodies, ostensibly because they weren’t cleaning up after themselves properly, while one child was beaten up for refusing to sleep.
