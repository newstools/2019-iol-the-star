Johannesburg - The Joburg CBD came to a standstill on Friday morning when the Joburg Road Agency (JRA) employees blocked roads with trucks, litter and burning tyres during a protest. A worker who was part of the protest said they were protesting for their salaries but declined to give further information pertaining to the issue. The JRA's Siyabonga Nodu said the agency had engaged with South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU) to discuss the historical pay progressions. He said the agency had explained to the union that they could not pay the outstanding amounts and that they wrote to them, proposing that they  go on arbitration on Wednesday. JRA employees use their truck to block roads, causing massive traffic congestion in the CBD. “We have proposed to the union to take the matter to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration or the Bargaining Council,” he said "Instead of the meeting between the agency and the union, we were shocked to see the protest by the employees,” he added. Nodu said they were worried about the safety of the properties as the workers were burning tyres and littering. Johannesburg Metro Police Department’s Wayne Minnaar said they deployed officer to regulate traffic at Pixley Seme street, which was the worst affected. Despite several attempts to contact the SAMWU, The Star could not get a hold of the union’s representative as his phone rang unanswered. The Star
