A massive outcry is expected by property owners and ratepayers against the City of Joburg’s proposed 8.9% in tariffs from July 1. The highest increase will be electricity which goes up by 12.2%, but which may drop when the final budget is passed in May in light of the National Electricity Regulator SA’s (Nersa) decision not to grant Eskom a 17.1% increase for 2019/20. Oscar Plange of the Northcliff Residents’ Association, which covers Randburg and Sandton, urged residents across the city to attend regional meetings held to discuss the tariffs and budget. “We are going to be demanding minimum service delivery standards, and we are expecting big support from residents who regularly complain about the lack of these,” he said. The 8.9% could be bigger in higher-end suburbs because there are stepped tariffs meaning that the more water and electricity residents use, the more they pay. Refuse collection and sewage also depends on the size of the property. Residents have until April 15 to object. Other increases include water (9.9%), sewage and sanitation (9.9%) and refuse (7%). The 60- to 69-year-old pensioner rebate thresholds have been increased by 5.5% which means that if the gross household income is under R9 752 a month, there will be a 100% rebate. For incomes between R9 734 and R16 716 a month, pensioners qualify for a 50% rebate. In announcing the new tariffs last month, mayor Herman Mashaba said the city had made extensive submissions during the Nersa public consultation process in objection to Eskom’s “exorbitant tariff increase request”. The city remained committed to keeping increases as close to inflation as possible but was subject to the tariff increases passed on to it by Eskom and Rand Water, he added. The total proposed budget is set at R65.6 billion for the 2019/20 financial year. This included R57.3bn in operational expenditure and R8.3bn in capital expenditure. The city meetings would also address infrastructure development plans for the suburbs to allow residents the opportunity to provide their input. Capital projects approved for the 2019/20 financial year would be presented at the meetings and residents would be given an opportunity to request projects for the financial year. The percentage of the capital budget spent on basic services such as roads, water, electricity, housing and transport has grown from 58% in 2016/17 to 71% for the 2019/20 financial year.
