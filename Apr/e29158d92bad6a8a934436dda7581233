The findings are contrary to the belief that marijuana users who have a serious case of the munchies that will ultimately lead to weight gain. “Over a three-year period, all participants showed a weight increase, but interestingly, those who used marijuana had less of an increase compared to those that never used,” said lead author Omayma Alshaarawy, from Michigan State University, in the US. For the study, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, the research team looked at the body mass index of 33000 participants, aged 18 and older, then compared the numbers. While the actual weight difference among users and non-users was modest, around 1kg for a 1.7m participant weighing about 90.7kg at the start of the study, the variance was prevalent among the entire sample size. Alshaarawy cautions that marijuana should not be considered a diet aid. “There’s too many health concerns around cannabis that far outweigh the potential positive, yet modest, effects it has on weight gain,” Alshaarawy said. “People shouldn’t consider it as a way to maintain or even lose weight.” -  IANS African News Agency (ANA)
