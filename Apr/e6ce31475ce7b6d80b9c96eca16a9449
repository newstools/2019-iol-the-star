“The GDE has noticed with disappointment that teaching and learning is not taking place at Oakdale Secondary School. "This is to inform the community that they have until Tuesday, April 23, 2019 to allow teaching and learning to resume, failing which MEC Panyaza Lesufi will have no other option but to assist them to officially close the school,” the GDE said in a statement. On Monday, Ennerdale residents protested against the lack of service delivery, which resulted in the closure of the school and the burning of a mobile classroom. “We have committed that a budget to replace Oakdale Secondary School has been approved, and as such, this school will be replaced. "However, we hope the community will yield to our call and allow the children to go back to school,” said Lesufi. African News Agency (ANA)
