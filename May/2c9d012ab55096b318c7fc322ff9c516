Parliament - President Cyril Ramaphosa has officially been sworn in as a member of the South African Parliament. Ramaphosa and several members of his current cabinet, including Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Gwede Mantashe, Lindiwe Sisulu, Pravin Gordhan, Zweli Mkhize, Naledi Pandor and Bheki Cele, were the first to be called to swear and oath an affirmation. Some in the group, including Gordhan, Sisulu and Cele, left their benches without the important piece of paper containing the words of the oath they were meant to swear to. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng reminded them to go and fetch it. The entire group swore in unison to "obey, respect and uphold the Constitution and all other law of the Republic".
