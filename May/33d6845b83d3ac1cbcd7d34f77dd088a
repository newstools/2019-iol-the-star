The high court in Joburg last week ruled that as he and his department had contravened a court order, they should be fined R10000 a day and the MEC face arrest. Liberty Community College, an independent school in Alexandra, first took the department to court last year over unpaid annual subsidies. The department pays independent and private schools subsidies every year for the running of their institutions. In 2015, Liberty was informed they didn’t qualify for a subsidy for the 2016 academic year and their appeal was dismissed without a reason, said the school’s lawyer Dominique Lloyd. When they applied for the 2017 academic year, they received a subsidy without any problems. Lloyd said the school then sued the department last year over the 2016 subsidy. “The department admitted they were wrong, and we had a court order by agreement. Since then, June 2018, we have not heard anything from the department,” she said. Lloyd added that the school finally took the department to court again last week. Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona said they were made aware of the matter on the day the latest order was made. “We are waiting for the state attorney to verify facts around this matter. If indeed there is such a court order, we will comply,” he said. The high court re-enforced last year’s order.
