Free State - Nine people who were trapped underground have been brought to the surface at the Joel Mine which falls under the Management of Harmony Gold Â in Theunissen, Free State. It was reported that eight men and a woman went underground on their night shift on Wednesday and were supposed to come back to the surface on Thursday morning. However, they never did which was when management realised that something was amiss and sent help. Speaking to SABC News, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union spokesperson, Xolani Bokoloshe said the nine miners did not return to surface after the motor of the mine cage was burned. The cage is the one used to transport miners from underground back to the surface. Bokoloshe said engineers managed to fix the cage motor and the mine workers were then returned to the surface. Bokoloshe added that the miners were taken to the medical station for medical attention. The Star
