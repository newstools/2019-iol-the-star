Johannesburg - A man who allegedly stole two firearms to "use in a commission of crime" was shot and killed in Kempton Park, on Monday. Gauteng police spokesperson, Captain Kay Makhubele said Ivory Park detectives arrested the four suspects linked to the killing around 4am on Wednesday. He said the 47-year-old victim stole two unlicensed firearms from two of the suspects under the pretence that he was going to use them to commit crime. “The suspects, whose ages range from 30 to 40, are alleged to have visited the deceased at his hiding place, demanded the firearms back and eventually shooting him multiple times on the upper body,” Makhubele said “The suspects were arrested in Ivory Park. During the arrest,  three firearms, including a police issued Z88, were recovered,” he added. Makhubela said  it was not clear when the victim stole the firearms from the suspects but that police were investigating the matter. Makhubele added the suspects face charges of murder and the possession of unlicensed firearm. They were expected to appear in court soon. The Gauteng Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela commended the Ivory Park detectives for arresting the suspects within a short space of time.
