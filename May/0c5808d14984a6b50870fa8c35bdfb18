Johannesburg - David Makhura has been re-elected as Gauteng Premier. Makhura got the most votes during the Gauteng legislature's swearing-in ceremony on Wednesday. The DA's Solly Msimanga had been nominated to stand against Makhura but lost out receiving only 32 votes while Makhura received 38 votes.
