A three year old boy was one of the people who died when three people succumbed to their injuries as two motor vehicles collided with each other on the R59 in Sasolburg, Free State. According to Netcare 911 spokesperson, Shawn Herbs, they accident happened around 4:30pm Sunday afternoon between an  Opel and Toyota which were involved in a head-on collision. “The Opel had three occupants on board. Tragically the adult male driver believed to be in his early 30s and a three-year-old male back passenger sustained fatal injuries and were declared deceased on the scene,” he added. Herbst said the female passenger in her late 20s from the Opel sustained moderate injuries and was stabilised on the scene before being transported by ambulance to hospital for future treatment. “A 42-year-old male was the only occupant of the Toyota, he was found to be in a critical condition trapped inside his car,” he said. Herbst added that the Fire and Rescue Services had to use the Jaws of Life to free the man from the wreckage.  However, the man went into cardiac arrest as he was being treated. “Paramedics initiated CPR however the man’s condition deteriorated and he succumbed to his injuries,” Herbst said. Circumstances that lead to the collision remains unknown and Sasolburg SAPS could not confirm on the incident.
