Johannesburg - DA leader Mmusi Maimane was in high spirits when he arrived at the Dobsonville Presbyterian Church where he was expected to cast his vote. Flanked by Gauteng premier candidate, Solly Msimanga, Maimane shared banter with the people he grew up with and shaking their hands. "We're here to bring change, we'll vote in Dobsonville today," he said. Both Msimanga and Maimane stood in the queue while awaiting their turn to vote. At some point he shared a joke with an elderly man who said he was his coach with both of them bursting into laughter. When an old woman who had just cast her voted stopped and greeted him he said: "Are you ok mommy? I'm glad that you voted," he said to an elderly woman.         The Star
