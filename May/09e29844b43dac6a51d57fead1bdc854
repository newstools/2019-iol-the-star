Patience and persevere have paid off for South Africa's Saray Khumalo who finally reached the top of Mount Everest on her fourth attempt. Khumalo reached the top on Thursday morning around 5.15am South African time. This achievement makes Khumalo the first black African woman summit Mount Everest, which is considered one of the most dangerous mountains in the world to try and climb. Khumalo first tried to summit Everest in 2014 but could not make it to the top as an avalanche hit the mountain. She tried again the following year but an earthquake that hit Nepal dashed her dream of getting to the top. In 2017, she tried again and was just about a 100 meters from the top when she suffered health problems due to exposure. She had to be airlifted to the hospital for treatment. Khumalo tried again in 2019 and finally made it to the top. After summiting Everest, a Facebook post on Summits with a Purpose read: UPDATE on Saray 9:00 am Nepal - 5:15 am South Africa !!! Everest Summit (8848m) !!! A short while ago Saray Nâ€™kusi Khumalo reached the top of the world. With her birth in Zambia, Rwandan bloodline and now a South African, this sister of Africa has achieved her goal of becoming the first black woman from Africa to summit Mount Everest.
