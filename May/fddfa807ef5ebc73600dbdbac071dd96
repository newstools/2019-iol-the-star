Johannesburg - Andile Mngxitama said his party will not back down on using the "land or death" slogan after the Equality Court ruled that it was hate speech. The court made the ruling on Monday morning following a complaint to the South African Human Rights Commission that the Black First Land First (BLF)'s political slogan was inciting violence. The court ordered BLF to remove the slogans from its regalia, social media accounts and website within a month. They were also ordered to  to issue a written apology to all South Africans within a  month. The apology was also to be published on the SAHRC website. Speaking on Radio 702 after the ruling, an angry Mngxitama accused the SAHRC of allowing itself to be a tool for racists and that they were inconsistent in their rulings. Mngxitama also said the they were being harassed by the SAHRC and would take the ruling on review. While some people welcomed the ruling, others disagreed with it, saying the courts were pandering to white fears.
