Protesters burnt two buses and two tow trucks during a service delivery protest action in Mzimhlophe, Soweto. It'is reported that the two buses belong to Putco and Reya Vaya. Authorities had to close the Soweto Highway between Carr Street and N17 while clearing the area where the vehicles were torched. According to Reya Vaya spokesperson Benny Makgoga, their bus was set alight around 6.30pm on Tuesday. He said the bus was being towed to the depot when protesters set it alight as well as the towing truck. Makgoga said the tow truck was forced to stop and after stopping he was pulled out of the vehicle by protesters. He said the driver sustained injuries on his head and was taken to hospital. “The operations are continuing as normal, and the area where the bus was torched does not fall within our routes,” Makgoga said. Soweto East Cluster police spokesperson Captain Hitler Ngwenya said the Mzimhlophe hostel dwellers were protesting about regular power cuts in the hostel on Tuesday night. Ngwenya said no injuries were been reported and police have restored calm in the area. Last month, residents from the same hostel took to the street their frustrations over power cuts and blocked the Soweto Highway. During the protest two Putco buses were torched by angry hostel dwellers. Putco could not be reached for comments. The Star
