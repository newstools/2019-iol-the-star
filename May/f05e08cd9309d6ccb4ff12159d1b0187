Johannesburg- The Air Traffic and Navigation Services handed over the 17th ICT infrastructure and science centre it has sponsored to Balondo Secondary School in Empangeni, near Richards Bay, KwaZulu-Natal. The sponsorship includes a science laboratory and apparatus, an ICT laboratory and equipment, as well as general infrastructural renovations. The handover was conducted by Deputy Minister of Transport Sindisiwe Chikunga at the school, which has 319 pupils, 72 of whom are in Grade 12. Thomas Kgokolo, ATNS interim chief executive, said: “Our commitment to aviation transformation programmes has driven our investment in the promotion of maths and physical and life sciences in schools that would otherwise have limited or no access to facilities to enhance opportunities for learning.” According to Kgokolo,  ATNS’s social transformation strategy was in line with South Africa’s Framework for Skills for a Changing World, which includes a focus on training learners to be proficient in emerging technologies such as the internet of things, robotics and artificial intelligence. “We have high hopes for the learners and educators at Balondo High School with this new contribution to their school’s facilities. We trust they will embrace the opportunities that are presented to them and strive for successful futures in an ever-changing and advancing technological world,” adds Kgokolo. The ICT and science centres are also increasing the pool of mathematics and science learners with the potential to train as air traffic controllers. The Star
