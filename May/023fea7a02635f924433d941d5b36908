After legal wrangles that caused postponements, parents will now be able to apply for admission for the 2020 school year. Applications for learners in Grades 1 and 8 for next year where supposed to start this week. However, they were abruptly postponed last Sunday following complaints from organisations including AfriForum, Skole-ondersteunongssentrum and Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysunie who complained about the new feeder zone and language regulations in the province. On Thursday morning, Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said after meetings with the disgruntled organisations,  the department “will update on changes effected by the technical team in the system to accommodate concerns raised by some stakeholders regarding the implementation of the newly Amended Admissions Regulations and Feeder Zones on the system accordingly.” Lesufi  will on Sunday announce what changes have been made onto the system. Parents can in the meantime log on to the system to familiarise themselves with it before  it goes live on Monday morning. The Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools (FEDSAS) one of  the organisations that were opposed to the regulations, said on Thursday in a statement that it was giving the go-ahead for applications to start. “We support the campaign to get parents as far as watching the video on how to fill in the application,” said Dr Jaco Deacon from FEDSAS.
