The unnamed man has allegedly performed similar stunts before, and this was known by the security guards on duty at the event at the Sandton Convention Centre over the weekend. Schwarzenegger was taking a Snapchat video of a gymnastics competition on Saturday when the flying kicker breached security and proceeded to kick him in the back in full view of everyone who was competing and watching. The man is the one who ended up falling after kicking Schwarzenegger.     Well damn. What Mr. Kimble do? üòØ#ArnoldSwarzenegger pic.twitter.com/2nS7ew5Tkg The security personnel responded by apprehending the offender and handing him over to police. Arnold Classic Africa organiser Wayne Price said the offender had carefully planned the incident. ‚ÄúNone of us could have foreseen that something like this could have taken place. Mr Schwarzenegger is fine and is still in good spirits‚Äù SAPS spokesperson Captain Stephen Malatji said the man was known to the police, but because a case was not opened, the investigating officer would not be doing further investigations. Schwarzenegger later confirmed that he would not be laying charges against the man.
