Early morning protests against illegal land invasion erupted in Lensia South, Johannesburg where residents’ barricaded roads with burning tyres and rocks. Motorists had to seek alternative routes as Wellington Road and Sheffield Street were closed off by angry residents calling for shack dwellers to be removed from the area. The claim is that the shack dwellers had invaded the land illegally and built their shacks there. Lenasia South police spokesperson, Sergeant Khalipha Mvula, said despite the barricaded roads, the protests were peaceful and no arrest had been made. He said that by mid morning, residents were addressed by Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers and then agreed to clear the roads. Mvula said the JMPD officers who deal with land invasions would go to where land invaders had illegally erected shacks and dismantle the structures. He also confirmed that there was a valid case for land invasion and that people from other areas were going to Lenasia to invade land there. “They are coming here and grab the land. Residents decided that enough is enough,” he said. He confirmed that that there were about 100 protesters but that there wasn’t any violence.
