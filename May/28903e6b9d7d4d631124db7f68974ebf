Netcare 911 paramedics responded at about 8.20am to reports of a serious accident on the N1 in the direction of Joburg between the Grasmere toll plaza and the N12, Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said. According to reports from the scene, multiple vehicles, including trucks, cars, minibus taxis, bakkies, and a bus, were involved in the pile-up. Paramedics assessed the scene and found that four people had sustained fatal injuries, two others sustained critical injuries and about 20 other people sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. They were transported by various ambulance services to hospital for further treatment. Motorists at the scene believed the crash might have occurred due to poor visibility resulting from either smoke or mist. All the necessary authorities had been at the scene, Herbst said. - African News Agency
