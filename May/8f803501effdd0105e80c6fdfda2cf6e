Their case was postponed to October 18, due to an urgent application they made at the North Gauteng High Court to review former national director of public prosecutions Shaun Abrahams' decision to prosecute them. The mineworkers are facing 26 counts, including attempted murder, murder, malicious damage to property, robbery, unlawful possession of firearms as well as unlawful possession of ammunition. The charges relate to the murder of 10 people preceding August 16, 2012 - the day on which 34 mineworkers were killed by the police during a violent wildcat strike at Lonmin platinum mine operations in Marikana. A warrant of arrest was issued for Samekelo Mkhize, who failed to appear in court. Initially, 19 people were arrested, but two have since died. Anele Zonke was remanded in custody while the other 16 accused had their bail of between R1000 and R2500 extended until their next appearance in court in October. Zonke is already serving a 42-year prison sentence after he was sentenced in February for the 2014 murder of Samancor chrome mine's human resources manager Goodman Zalukano and the attempted murder of Thandi Zulakangana, in Kroondal near Rustenburg. Zalukano and Zulakangana were attacked by Zonke together with Sandiso Majaxa and Siyabulela Nqwilelo outside a shopping complex. Majaxa and Nqwilelo were each sentenced to 41 years behind bars for their role in the crime. - African News Agency (ANA)
