Police are looking for a suspect who dumped a newborn baby who was then eaten by dogs. The body of the newborn was found  on Wednesday in an open field without a right leg and private parts in Schoonplaas informal settlement, Springs Captain Johannes Ramphora said police received information of a dead body on an infant with missing parts at an open field. It is alleged that a passerby saw dogs feeding on human flesh and quickly went back to the community and alerted others. Police were later informed. "When we arrived, we found a dead body of an infant with missing parts,” Ramphora said. He said it was hard to tell the gender of the baby as the genitals were missing. A case of concealment of birth was opened and police are appealing to community members to help them with the whereabouts of the suspect. Ramphora said it was not clear when did the actual dumping of the infant happened, but that it was suspected to have happened on Tuesday evening or early hours of Wednesday. The Star
