Johannesburg - Almost 200 000 parents of Grade 1 and 8 learners have applied for places for their children in the 2020 academic year via the Gauteng department of education's (GDE) online admissions system. The GDE's online admissions system went live at 8 am on Monday and parents came out in their numbers to the Diepsloot Youth Centre to get assistance with the process from GDE officials. "Last year this time we were sitting at 100 000 applications, today we are sitting at 195 000 which means we have almost doubled that number," Gauteng member of the executive council for eduction Panyaza Lesufi told journalists while monitoring the event. "Remember we have 320 000 spaces so if we are already at almost 200 000 we are reaching our target." Parents said they were pleased by the speedy process, with some applauding the department for offering assistance at the centre as they were unemployed and did not have internet access at home.
