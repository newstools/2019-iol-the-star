Nando’s announced that citizens who showed up at their restaurants with their voter’s mark on their thumbs would get a quarter chicken meal with chips and a roll for R29. “Our democracy isn’t having a quarter-century life crisis, it’s just getting started,” said the company. Galito’s restaurant was also offering a R25 elections special called #R25FOR 25YEARS. People could visit any Galito’s store  and get one quarter chicken and chips meal. The R25 deal was to celebrate 25 years of democracy. Wimpy kept voters warm after standing in the cold weather and gave away free cups of Famous Wimpy Coffee to anyone with a voter’s mark. “Just show us that you’ve made your mark,” Wimpy said in a tweet.
