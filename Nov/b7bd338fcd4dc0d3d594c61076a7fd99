Johannesburg - The spat between AfriForum and Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has taken an ugly turn, this time with the lobby group threatening to sue Lesufi for claiming the group was behind an assassination plot against him. This in reference to the lobby group's recent campaign calling for the removal of Lesufi. The campaign included an online petition, a memorandum handed over to Gauteng Premier David Makhura and the laying of criminal charges over the misappropriation of "more than R900 million". "We are resolute, all our schools in this province belong to all our children. Gone are the days of schools that belong to kleinbaases alone. There will be no kleinbaas only schools in this province. This did not sit well with AfriForum executives, who accused Lesufi of "blatantly lying" in his claim of an assassination attempt and indicating its intention to take legal action against him for defamation.
