Cape Town - The SAA board has warned Parliament that there will be no flights to take off if a strike by the unions goes ahead. This was after the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the SA Cabin Crew Association issued a strike notice over the planned retrenchments of 944 workers. SAA board acting chairperson Thandeka Mgoduso told the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on Wednesday if the strike went ahead it would cause more financial damage to the airline. The board was appearing before Scopa over its finances. Mgoduso said the consultations with the unions have not succeeded on the restructuring at SAA. “We have received notifications from Numsa and the Cabin Crew Association this morning. Once there is no cabin crew there is no flight that can take off,” said Mgoduso. She said MPs should not be surprised if the financial situation does not improve after the strike. The unions are demanding salary increases and to stop the retrenchment of the 944 workers. Political Bureau
