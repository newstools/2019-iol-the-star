Johannesburg - Bogus doctors are running amok in Ekurhuleni as more arrests are being made in efforts to crack down on them. Ghanaian Kumi Daniel was arrested in Duduza while operating a surgery without being registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA). He had been working from Dr Ogbonnaya Orji’s practice in Mandela Drive. On November 6, three alleged fake doctors were nabbed in Springs, Ekurhuleni. They had been operating at the Palm Ridge Shopping Mall at the time of their arrests. A Congolese national, 46, who was also arrested, told the police he owned the practice. At the same practice a Nigerian man, who had been drawing blood from a patient, claimed to be a qualified doctor while his accomplice, 36, was dispensing medicine to patients. Officials from the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) said that it was a criminal offence to practise while unregistered. “Employing unregistered persons is unethical conduct by the registered practitioner. As a result, the practitioner is subjected to a disciplinary process for unprofessional conduct,” said Daphney Chuma, HPCSA’s corporate affairs head. She said bogus practitioners were ruining the image of the profession while also risking the lives of patients. “This also tarnishes the image of the profession. “Unregistered persons do not fall within the HPCSA’s jurisdiction and should they conduct themselves unethically, HPCSA cannot implement its processes,” she said. The council is conducting public awareness campaigns throughout the country to educate the public on how to identify these bogus practitioners and how to report them to the council. Last month, Mantoa Alinah Phora was arrested in Ratanda for selling fraudulent medical certificates from her home. Another Congolese national, Eureck Mukonkole, also from Ratanda, was nabbed for operating an illegal practice. lehlohonolo.mashigo@inl.co.za The Star
