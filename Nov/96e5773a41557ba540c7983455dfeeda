Johannesburg - The case against the nanny accused of killing Langelihle Mnguni was postponed in the Benoni Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. Mannana Celinah Tsabane briefly appeared in a packed courtroom before the case was postponed to November 8, for formal bail application. The East Rand childminder was arrested for allegedly killing the one-year-old that she has been taking care of since he was two-months-old. When Mnguni's mother arrived home from work two weeks ago her sonâ€™s nanny told her that robbers had poisoned her, as well as Langelihle and that they then kidnapped the toddler. The post-mortem revealed that the toddler's neck was fractured and he was suffocated. The Daveyton community came out in their numbers to support the Mnguni family in court with placards written on: 'no bail' and '#JusticeForLangelihle'. African News Agency/ANA
