#IdolsSA hawu Unathi you said this👇🏾@IdolsSA @Mzansimagic #Luyolo pic.twitter.com/BzH3WCTaZN "IF" you hurt our feeling? @Unathi_Africa I love you but this apology is not accepted. You are aware that you broke our heart, then you turn around and say "IF" you hurt our feelings. I know you can do better sisi. #unathi #IdolsSA pic.twitter.com/irc9hvOd18 Unathi just jeopardized Luyolo's chances in winning. That tribal joke was really not necessary #IdolsSA pic.twitter.com/26fNAB6i9p As the Xhosa delegation, we are distancing ourselves from the words spoken by Unathi. Luyolo has worked extremely hard to get to where he is today. He does not deserve to be punished for Unathi's ignorance. Do the right thing, vote Luyolo for clear skin. pic.twitter.com/aCxUifelIE Lol I can’t believe Unathi, an entire judge, turned Luyolo’s performance into a matter of tribes. So because he’s Xhosa he’s more deserving? Fuck that #IdolsSA pic.twitter.com/eSXXduG7vB  🙏🏾 A post shared by  Unathi.Africa (@unathi.co) on Nov 10, 2019 at 11:29am PST
