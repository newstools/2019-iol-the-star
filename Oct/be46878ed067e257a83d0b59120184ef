Cape Town - The ructions in the Democratic Alliance (DA) continued on Thursday with the party’s caucus in Parliament expected to axe Mmusi Maimane. This comes after his statement on Wednesday where he slammed the party after his resignation. The caucus is meeting in Parliament and is set to fire Maimane. Maimane had remained as Parliamentary leader after he resigned as DA leader but he is expected to be removed as leader of the party in the national legislature. DA federal council chairperson Helen Zille had said they had not encountered this situation before and would seek legal advice on how to move forward. Both Maimane and federal chairperson Athol Trollip resigned on Wednesday after a marathon meeting in Bruma, east of Johannesburg. This followed the weekend meeting of the federal council where Zille was elected into the position of James Selfe. Herman Mashaba, the outgoing mayor of the City of Joburg, was the first to go. He had said he was going to resign if Zille was elected into the party’s influential position. Political Bureau
