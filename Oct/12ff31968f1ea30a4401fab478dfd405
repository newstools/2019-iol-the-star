Ekurhuleni- A shack fire broke out leaving hundreds homeless on Monday evening. The Pomona Informal Settlement shacks on Great North Road towards Benoni went up in flames. Spokesperson for Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Management Services (DEMS) Aaron Mafunda said the fire broke out between 6pm and 7pm, destroying close to 200 shacks in the process. "There were no casualties and the fire took firefighters about three hours to put out." In a video posted by Yusuf Abramjee on Twitter, residents can be seen rushing to save their belongings while their homes go up in flames.     Those left homeless were offered to be taken to the Kempton Park city hall and the Dries Niemandt Park, however Mafunda said the residents refused to be relocated, fearing their belongings would be taken. "They said they would see what to do even though EMPD was available to ensure their belongings would not be taken." He added that many of the residents managed to salvage their belongings before the fire engulfed their homes in flames. Last year shacks in the informal settlement were demolished as they were built too close to the Great North Road. The cause of the fire has not yet been established.
