Johannesburg - Two people were killed and two others arrested following a shootout with the police at the Magatle police precinct in Lebowakgomo cluster. The incident happened on Wednesday. Limpopo police spokesperson, Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said police were conducting their daily patrol duties when they received a tip-off about a black Mercedes Benz with four occupants and which had just committed a robbery in the area. “Police followed the information and spotted the vehicle with the same description at Moletlane village,” he added. Ngoepe said they tried to stop the vehicle but it sped-off and a high-speed chase ensued. The suspects are alleged to have only stopped at Ntamatise village and started shooting at the police. Ngoepe said police retaliated, resulting in two of the four suspects being killed and the other two arrested. Unlicensed firearms with live ammunition were also found on the men. “The two arrested suspects will soon appear before the Thabamoopo Magistrates' Court on charges of business robbery, attempted murder and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition,” he added. He further added that police investigations into the robbery were still underway and that the identities of the two deceased suspects was not known yet. The Star
