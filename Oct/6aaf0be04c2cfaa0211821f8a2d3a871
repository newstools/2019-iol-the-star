Johannesburg - A 28-years-old Mozambican rapist who terrorised Ekurhuleni women, especially in Zonkezizwe and Palm Ridge, has been slapped with eight life sentences and an additional 32-years behind bars. He was sentenced on Tuesday at the South Gauteng High Court. Selemane Bonito and four other men gang-raped their victims, some of whom were still school children. Bonito faced 20 counts of rape, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition, and robbery committed from as far back as 2013. It was stated in court that Bonito and his friends would gather at taxi ranks to spot potential victims and follow them then grab and drag them into the fields where they would all gang-rape them. Bonito's accomplices are still at large. During the proceeding his legal team said the court should consider the fact that while committing such crimes the accused was still young. The court was also asked to consider the fact that Bonito was raised in an dysfunctional family. However, the prosecution dismissed that, saying Bonito was of legal age and and mature when he committed the crimes. In aggravation of sentence, the prosecution also pleaded with the court to take into consideration the fact that Bonito planned and gang-raped the victims with four other people. The Star
