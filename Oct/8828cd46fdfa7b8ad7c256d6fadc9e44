Johannesburg - The State Capture Commission of Inquiry will resume on Tuesday morning with former president Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane expected to wrap up his testimony. Zuma was first grilled about a meeting in October 2015 in which former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas alleged that he was taken to the Gupta compound by Zuma and offered R600 million if he took up the post of finance minister from Nhlanhla Nene, who was going to be fired. While Zuma and Jonas have conflicting versions about how the meeting transpired, they have both confirmed that the meeting took place. Zuma also faced questions relating to the testimony of former Free State MEC Mxolisi Dukwana, denying the latter's statement or ever having met the former official.

The commission will also hear testimony relating to the botched Vrede Dairy Farm project from a Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries official Elder Mtshisa and Memel estate agent Johannes Theron. * For latest State Capture Inquiry news, click here
