Cape Town - DA federal council chairperson Helen Zille has confirmed on Friday they will elect the interim leader in the next three weeks. This followed the resignation of Mmusi Maimane this week, and he was followed by federal chairperson Athol Trollip. Zille said on Twitter the federal council had agreed that it would elect the interim leader on November 17. The DA has been rattled by the departure of senior leaders following the election of Zille into her current position at the weekend. But Zille said they have managed to steady the ship. “On 17 November we have a special federal council to elect an interim leader and an interim chair. Full congress in April 2020. In the meantime all structures are functional and stable. Parliamentary caucus elects a new leader within a week, who will appoint a new chief whip,” said Zille.     Former Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba was the first to go after he stuck to his promise that she will resign if Zille was elected federal council chairperson. The next day Maimane and Trollip quit.
