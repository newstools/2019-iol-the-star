Johannesburg - Four illegal miners were to appear in court on Thursday after they were found in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition in Krugersdorp. The men were found in an area known for incidents where marauding gangs of illegal miners are known to be terrorising the community then fleeing and hiding at the Old Mogale Mine. Gauteng police spokesperson, Captain Kay Makhubele said officers from the Crime Prevention Unit were conducting an operation in Krugersdorp's old Gold Mine at West Village on Tuesday when they nabbed the suspects. “During the operation, police pounced on a group of more than 30 illegal miners. Four suspects aged between 30 and 35 were found in possession of unlicensed firearms of different caliber such as R5, R1, short-gun  and a pistol, and ammunition,” Makhubele said. “Gauteng police management commended the good work by the Krugersdorp Crime Prevention for continuing to bring a halt to illegal mining and recover illegal firearms in the area,” he said. On September 17, police arrested an illegal miner after two people were shot dead and four others wounded in Kromdraai informal settlement, Krugersdorp. The suspect was found wounded in the lower body after police responded to a complaint of a shooting between illegal miners. He was also found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and was arrested. Investigations further revealed that the suspect was part of the rival group hailing from either Soweto or Munsieville. The Star
