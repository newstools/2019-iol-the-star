For the last three years, the Nubian Music Festival has been part of the calendar of events to attend for many people. Organiser Mpho Mathope is the woman who brought the festival to life in 2017. Mathope’s career in the hospitality sector and extensive knowledge helped her gauge what people were interested in when it comes to events. The festival, she says, is about taking people back to their roots, supporting local and investing in travel around different parts of the country. The Eagle Waters Wildlife Resort in Hartbeespoort is home to the three-day cultural festival that took place from December 13 to 16. Mathope describes the festival as a family oriented series of events that include activities for children and adults to enjoy. Guests who attended could enjoy the main concert that took place on Sunday featuring Amanda Black, The Soil, Thandiswa Mazwai, Judith Sephuma, Lira, Ringo Madlingozi, Mafikizolo and Micasa. Highlight performances included Mazwai, Sephuma and Mafikizolo who had the audience singing and dancing to their entire sets. Madlingozi dressed in a red top and shoes with the EFF party emblem performed fan favourites as well. This year’s main concert was well attended. The all-local line-up was part of the mission Mathope has set out for the festival, to bring people quality performances from their own soil. Mathope added that the festival was a lifestyle that promoted social togetherness and cultural tolerance. “When you think Nubian, you think Africa. I’m proud to be part of such a unique festival that celebrates Africa and our roots and also to perform alongside an incredible calibre of musicians,” said Buhlebendalo Mda, one third of The Soil. Planning an event of this magnitude takes up to eight months. Mathope, who has been in the eventing business since 1990, knows her way around events. This year the festival was hosted by Sammy “Sammy Fever” Mashabane and media personality Penny Lebyane.
