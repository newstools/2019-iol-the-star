Cape Town - South Africans have been struggling to keep up with all the constant changes in load shedding stages, with the result leaving some even having their power cut twice in one day. On Monday, barely hours after announcing the continuation of Stage 2 load shedding, Eskom has confirmed that this will move to Stage 4 from 10am until 11pm. The entity also said the probability of load shedding remained high for the week as a result of a shortage of capacity. Earlier this year the Western Cape MEC for Finance and Economic Opportunities, David Maynier, revealed that load shedding cost the Western Cape economy R150 million per day. Maynier said the Western Cape government had taken a number of actions to mitigate the impact of load shedding on the provincial economy and build energy resilience. Despite this, the cost remained high, particularly for manufacturing. And this just for the Western Cape alone. Besides the toll on the economy, load shedding has also had a massive effect on the lives of SA residents. From the serious to the lighthearted, these are some of the sentiments and feelings shared by many South Africans as they endure the struggle of load shedding:     Stage 4 #LoadsheddingI should have bought myself a generator during #BlackFriday2019 instead of jeans 😭😭 pic.twitter.com/BSlClTiAmB     Eskom: sorry guys we have to implement Stage 4 loadshedding because the coals got wet.South Africans: pic.twitter.com/6HrpmO0c14     I go to sleep during loadshedding and then wake up AGAIN THE NEXT DAY to loadshedding again😤     The way this #Loadshedding is stressing me out. Imma be fat by the time it’s over. When I’m stressed I raid the fridge. And being single now there is no-one to give me the side eye 😎 about eating things like ice cream after dinner pic.twitter.com/HvBUbx6LGW     I am taking this opportunity during this loadshedding season to wear crinkled clothing all the time."Ugh, loadshedding, you know"     If my ps4 doesn't go on when loadshedding is finished, I swear @Eskom_SA you buying me a new one 🤬😠😠😠😠😠😠😠     Fvck nudes, send me loadshedding schedule     My grandad bought these lamps because of the loadshedding and it really makes walking around the house feel like a first-person horror game pic.twitter.com/hUqmDnjGsx  There were some who pointed out that one thing you could always rely on, when it came to Eskom, was it's punctuality and efficiency for implementing load shedding on the scheduled time.     I just want to take a moment to applaud the punctuality of loadshedding. When they say 8am, it’s 8am. Metrorail can learn from Eskom.     The guy who switches #Loadshedding on doesn't do bantu time.     The one thing that government gets right without fail, loadshedding time. If it's 14:00 you best believe it it's going to be right on the dot or to be impressive, thirty minutes before. #ShitKom     Loadshedding is literally the only thing that gets done on time in this country😂 Others have found their days becoming harder to start as Eskom has been getting in the way of their coffee-drinking.     Loadshedding before you've had the chance to make a cup of coffee. F&&$ you Eskom! 😡😡😡     No amount of this government sponsored #loadshedding will prevent me from having my cup of coffee. pic.twitter.com/Fsbf0TTQD5     Someone please design a kettle that works with batteries so I can make coffee during loadshedding     When people hear loadshedding would happen in the next hour, there was a stampede to the coffee shops for that strong cup to see them through 2 and a half hours of no technology and no idea what to do! #loadshedding #coffeelovers     #Loadshedding came between me and my coffee this morning. there are some things that are just not tolerable...     When Twitter distracts you from making your morning coffee then you discover that there's #Loadshedding when you eventually get up to make it. pic.twitter.com/c2R3MuFcfk  Data prices are already causing financial difficulty for cash-strapped South Africans, but due to load shedding, residents have not only had to use more of their data, but also put up with diminishing signal quality as some service providers are being impacted by the power cuts.     Eskom needs to pay for all the data i use during loadshedding 😔     So signal must also go when there’s loadshedding?😓     I so wish loadshedding didn’t go with my cellphone reception 🙃     We pay a premium for data and services yet we get a sub standard customer experience. That's what happens when most of the market is held by 1 player. They can just focus on profits and not really give AF about their customers. Loadshedding has been going on forever.@vodacom pic.twitter.com/0wrxkCrwAe     The cost associated with load shedding like data must be tax deductable#Loadshedding  Not even the clubs are safe from feeling the cost of load shedding:     What’s happening in clubs vele? #Loadshedding     Right after they closed the club due to loadshedding, the lights decided to finally come back on and now everyone is cancelling their Uber’s and waking back into the club. What a time. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

Complaints aside, there has been a number of social media users who have raised the issue of how power cuts have been affecting their safety and is likely impacting on crime.     December is the worst time for load shedding, this period is probably the most dangerous time of the year. The last thing we need is darkness while criminals lurk #Loadshedding     This is a safety issue , will be victims of crime because of this #Loadshedding     Just like that, my already dodgy, crime-ridden area has been plunged into darkness as our Power Utility are shutting off sections of the grid for 2 hours at a time, due to decades of neglect, graft and malfeasance. I’ll be outside warding off numbers gangsters. #Loadshedding pic.twitter.com/x9guGI41ws     In a country with so much crime this loadshedding is actually putting us at harms way.  Others just want to 'Ke Dezemba Boss' in peace and enjoy their festive season, but Eskom has put a damper on those plans:     This December will be borring with all this loadshedding how are we supposed waste our savings kahle Kahle? ANC needs to do better man     I won’t let this weather and loadshedding stop me from grooving this December🚶🏽‍♂️     So Eskom planed to Ruin our December nge #Loadshedding ? pic.twitter.com/v6sC6tCO3t     Loadshedding in December is unconstitutional     Loadshedding in December? We've hit an all time low. Cape Argus
