But on Thursday, the Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) confirmed that the bridge had not collapsed. After a full inspection by JRA engineers on Thursday, it was concluded that the stormwater drainage system meant to take water from the top of the bridge to the bottom had failed. This led to water running down the bridge joints and causing erosion to the paving and soil that make the bridge embankment and abutment. JRA spokesperson Zoleka Jika said they are committed to providing a well maintained and safe bridge. “The bridge structure is sound and safe for use at the moment.” The JRA, through its maintenance team, is in the process of putting in place holding measures. Jika said the situation will be monitored until full rehabilitation is concluded. He said the stormwater system required urgent rehabilitation, but due to the holidays, the rehabilitation could only be done next month. “The JRA would like to assure road users that the safety of roads and bridges remains JRA’s top priority,” Jika said.
