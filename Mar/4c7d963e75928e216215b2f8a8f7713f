This after the Gauteng Transport Department announced it had cleared 85% of the backlog. However, several motorists who applied for their renewals as far back as August claim the department has no records of their applications. Last week, MEC for Transport Ismail Vadi said the driving licence card account successfully managed to clear a large backlog relating to the late production of driver licence cards due to labour action. The department admitted that a prolonged strike last year, as well as technical glitches from an IT systems upgrade, had resulted in the province having a backlog of 522900 licences. “I am satisfied that good progress is being made in resolving the backlog in licence production, as 437899 licence cards have been processed to date and are being distributed to testing centres,” said Vadi.
