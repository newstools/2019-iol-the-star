His arch-rival Cassper Nyovest mocks the "Fela In Versace" star when on his banging track "Monate Mpolaye", the popular verses on the track states "“Se reng Ciroc mo ngwaneng...ga re batle magapu,” which loosely translates to “we don’t want watermelons”. The Megacy had a blast on Twitter yesterday, bashing Cassper for his diss gone wrong track, with many reminding him that he doesn't own the alcohol brand Ciroc, he is merely the brand ambassador.
