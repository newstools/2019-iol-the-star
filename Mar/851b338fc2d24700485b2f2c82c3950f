All political parties registered with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) will have to reveal donations beyond R100 000 a year. “All donations received by political parties which exceed the disclosure threshold must be reported to the commission,” reads the draft regulations. The IEC will publish a list of all donations received by political parties quarterly.
