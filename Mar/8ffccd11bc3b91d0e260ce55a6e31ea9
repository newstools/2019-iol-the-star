The KZN-born singer is slowly making a name for herself on the music scene, with Ntaba Ezikude and Sonini already being huge hits, as she was introduced to fans by Sun-EL Musician. Their relationship goes back to 2013, to her university days when they would talk about making music together. “I discovered my voice back in primary school, but didn't take it seriously because I didn't think people would be in love with Simmy’s voice. But as time went on, I realised I could do it professionally.” It was in 2016 that she really started being serious about singing as a career. “I linked up with Sun-EL Musician to talk about the conversation we had back in varsity. I said 'let's do it now and let's get in studio'.” As her star continues to shine, Simmy will join the likes of AKA, Sho Madjozi, Shane Eagle, Busiswa, DJ Maphorisa, Rouge, DJ Kent, Sjava, Mlindo The Vocalist and DJ Zan-D at the second VW VIVOnation two-day music and lifestyle festival. “I'm grateful for the opportunity. The festival was only supposed to take place last year as a once-off. I am super happy to be part of the second edition.” She said fans could look forward to hearing a lot of music from her own album, Tugela Ferry, as well as a lot of crazy dance moves. “My music is a mixture of modern maskandi and folk music, combined with electro house. That's the type of vibe I am in. My plans for this year include releasing more music from my album and features with artists I was not able to feature on my album.” Taking place at The Container Yard next month, the festival is all about showcasing proudly South African talent and experiences, with the VW Vivo models. VW spokesperson Lindi Hilliar said: “Last year it was such a success, from the coverage to the sentiment with the people who attended. We are keeping the bulk of the elements the same, with the focus being on home-grown talent and getting people to experience the vehicles in cool ways.” The event will take place on April 6 and 7.
