For regular attendees who come monthly to the Birchwood Comes Alive jazz evening, the experience is one worth seeing over and over again. On Friday, along with Jazz Meloz, Beyond Vocal and Mmatema Moremi, Madlingozi gave a special tribute performance to the late Oliver Mtukudzi. Mtukudzi’s daughters Selmor and Sandra also performed some of their father’s greatest hits, including Neria and Todii. During their tribute performance, Selmor thanked the Birchwood Hotel and OR Tambo Conference Centre for the support they always showed their father. The family was presented with a special in memoriam award. Jazz Meloz set the tone for the night with their performance, followed by amazing a cappella renditions of various popular songs by Beyond Vocal. The group kept the audience on their feet with songs by some of the country’s top artists. Moremi was on top form vocally. Her interaction with the audience was key as she pulled them on with romantic ballads. Her performance with the Mtukudzi sisters was a show-stopper as their choreographed dance piece was met with loud claps from the audience. By the time Madlingozi hit the stage, the venue had turned into a real celebration. He sang all the fan favourites, including Kum Nakum, Ndiyagodola, Nkqo Nkqo Nkqo and his hit with Mtukudzi, Into Yam. Madlingozi’s soothing voice and energetic stage presence had the audience on their feet and surrounding him on stage into the early hours of the morning. The Birchwood experience is always a treat for music lovers young and old to mingle, reminisce and enjoy African talent.
