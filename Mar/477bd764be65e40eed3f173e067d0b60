DURBAN - Eskom said on Tuesday night that it would continue with Stage 4 load shedding on Wednesday. On Tuesday night, load shedding would be on Stage 2 from 11pm until 9am on Wednesday morning. Stage 4 would then be  implemented on Wednesday from 9am to 11pm.  "This is due to a shortage of capacity," said Eskom via an emailed statement. "Load shedding is a highly controlled process, implemented to protect the system and to prevent a total collapse of the system or a national blackout. During Stage 4 load shedding, approximately 80% of the country’s demand is still being met," said the statement. Eskom’s maintenance teams were working round-the-clock to return generation units to the electricity system. Stage 2 calls for 2000MW, Stage 3 calls for 3000MW, and Stage 4 calls for 4000MW to be rotationally load shed nationally at a given period. "We appeal to customers to switch off geysers during the day as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. Remember to treat all electrical points as live during load shedding," said Eskom.
