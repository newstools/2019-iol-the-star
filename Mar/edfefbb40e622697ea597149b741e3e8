Johannesburg - Classes were expected to resume at the Tshwane University of Technology campuses on Monday, several weeks after academic activities were suspended. The institution had shut its doors due to the students' continued protests for financial support for poor students as well as accommodation shortages. In a statement, TUT management said the decision to resume classes was taken after a thorough risk assessment and careful consideration of the situation at all campuses. "Sufficient measures have been put in place to ensure an academically conducive environment as well as the safety of students, staff and TUT property," it said. "Management is engaging tirelessly with all relevant stakeholders to resolve the issues that resulted in the indefinite suspension of the academic programme on March 6." The institution also said it would also move examinations from May to June in an effort to ensure that students were adequately prepared to take them. On Sunday, higher education Minister Naledi Pandor allocated R967 million to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme to settle the historic debt owed to universities by 52,514 students funded by the programme. - African News Agency
