Johannesburg - Robbers shot and killed an off-duty police officer when he ran into a store upon hearing his daughter scream during a robbery. The incident happened in Vosloorus on Thursday. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said preliminary investigations revealed that the officer's wife and daughter fell victim to a robbery inside a store during which the store owner activated the security alarm. “The daughter managed to run out of the store to alert her father who had parked his vehicle close to the entrance,” Peters said “In response to the alarm and the daughter's cry, the deceased allegedly ran into the store and was then shot at from behind by the suspects,” she added.
