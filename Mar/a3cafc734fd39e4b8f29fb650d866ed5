He said the government had approved the new regulations on school admissions, and that parents could now apply to schools within a 30km radius of their homes. This has changed from the previous 5km radius. “We are changing the look and feel of all of our schools in the province. "This simply means non-racialism is now entrenched and parents will now have proper choice, without unnecessary restrictions,” Lesufi said. The new regulations mean that learners from any background are allowed to apply to any school despite their financial status and their residential address and parents' work address. Lesufi, however, emphasised that the changes should not give parents an excuse to apply late for admission. “You have to apply on time. Those who apply early and are within the feeder zone will be considered first,” he said. According to the department, about 335 schools contested their proposed feeder zones in about 2060 maps drawn up by the department. Other changes to regulations include that the head of department now has the power to administer admissions; and all forms of unfair discrimination are outlawed. The department will publish the amendments on its website, and the regulations will be effective from the date of publication.
