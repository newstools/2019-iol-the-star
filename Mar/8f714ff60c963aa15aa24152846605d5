Last week Trevor Noah pleaded to the "The Daily Show" fans to save the show from being canned. Taking to Twitter, Noah posted a video with the caption:Â "AT&T-DIRECTV is about to drop Comedy Central and up to 22 other channels. If that happens, you wonâ€™t be able to watch The Daily Show with me! Call 888-250-5557 and tell AT&T-DIRECTV to keep Comedy Central. Go to (link: http://keepviacom.com) keepviacom.com for more info. #keepviacom".     AT&T-DIRECTV is about to drop Comedy Central and up to 22 other channels. If that happens, you wonâ€™t be able to watch The Daily Show with me! Call 888-250-5557 and tell AT&T-DIRECTV to keep Comedy Central.

The official Viacom Twitter page posted on Monday that a deal had been struck between AT&T Direct and Viacom. Stating that their contract has been renewed and that ViacomÂ services will continue to be available onÂ  AT&T platforms & products.     We're pleased to announce a renewed Viacom-AT&T contract with continued carriage of Viacom services across multiple AT&T platforms & products. The deal brings AT&T customers more choice & improved value for Viacom content. We expect to share more details in the near future. While Trevor's Daily Show rein continues, the initial reaction to the possibility of the show being canned created a Twitter divide as some where for his exit, while others supported his call to action. See reactions below.     Uhhh AT&T!!!! You better watch yourself! My service has been nuts lately & now youâ€™ve crossed the line. I need my @Trevornoah We ALL need some @Trevornoah     Dream come true.     Trevor, 2wks ago I was fortunate to be part of the live studio audience of the Daily Show in NYC... you were awesome then and made all of us saffas feel so proud! Long live the Daily Show... long live!!!!     @Trevornoah will overcome this. #Republicans are just getting uncomfortable with the truth being exposed. Letâ€™s support Trevor!     I have never watched you or Comedy Central - and I have no interest to start now. I'm glad they are eliminating the Lowest Rated 22 channels. We wish you the best ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­     I'm on his side. I love Trevor... I hope they don't cancel his show..
