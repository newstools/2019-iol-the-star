Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said the two guards sustained critical injuries. “One of the adult males sustained a gunshot wound to the head and the other male was found with gunshot wound to his upper body,” Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said. Ramaube said there were about eight to to 10 suspects and about four of them were armed with rifles. He said on arrival, police found the suspects blocking the road with two VW Golf GTIs and the shootout between the suspects and police ensued. “The suspect fled the scene with two cars and none of our members were injured during the shootout,” Ramaube said.
