Johannesburg - A 16-year-old Mondeor High School pupil was stabbed to death outside the school on Wednesday morning. It's not yet known what the motive for the teenager's killing was. According to one of the police officers at Mondeor Police Station which is near the school, a man came running into the charge office saying a school child had been stabbed. The officer, who can't be named as she's not the official spokesperson, said they called an ambulance and rushed to where the boy was. "The boy was a pupil at Mondeor. Paramedics later arrived and confirmed the boy dead," she said. The officer could not confirm if the teenager had been robbed of any of his belongings. ER24's Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived at the scene at 8.14 and found that other paramedics were already there, busy assessing the teenager. "Assessments showed that the patient had sustained a stab wound to his chest and showed no signs of life. "CPR and treatment were immediately initiated, in an effort to revive the patient.
