The organisation, which observed World TB Day on Sunday, said the disease claims more than 4500 lives a day. The annual event, celebrated in March each year, is designed to raise public awareness about the devastating health, social and economic consequences of TB, as well as the steps being taken to end the global TB epidemic. The organisation also reported that global efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated 54 million lives since the year 2000 and had also reduced the TB mortality rate by 42%. In 2017, South Africa reported 22000 deaths from TB. This number excluded those who suffered from both TB and HIV infections, as those deaths were attributed to HIV. Public service trade union, Health & Other Services Personnel Trade Union of South Africa, said it believed it was time for the government to address the high prevalence of TB in the country, especially among healthcare workers.
