Johannesburg - Students at the Vaal University of Technology (VUT) blocked the main entrance of the university on Monday morning as they embarked on a protest. The students were allegedly protesting against the non-payment their National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) allowances. They were also demanding that VUT allow students who qualify for free education to register. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said police were called to the institution at 9:30 am on Monday morning where approximately 400 students had blocked Andries Potgieter and R42 Roads in Vanderbijlpark with rocks. The Star tried to get a comment from the university but calls went unanswered. Videos posted on Twitter by students present at the protest showed a large group of students running through the streets in the rain. Masondo confirmed that the police fired rubber bullets at the protesting students to disperse the crowd. “The roads are now open for traffic and the situation is calm,” said Masondo. Last week Wits students protested and embarked on a hunger strike over the same issue. The Star
