The question one needs to ask is: Are the people these “charities” supposedly help / feed, in actual fact, benefiting from the funds, goods and perishable / non-perishable foods donated? At one “charity” (a registered NPO), in a suburb close to the Johannesburg CBD, salaried staff take home carrier-bags full of donated perishable and non-perishable foods, clothing and other goods whenever they are donated. At this same “charity”, the poor and hungry people, should they arrive a little late for the soup kitchen, are often turned away without so much as a crust of bread. Often, should the person linger or plead, he / she is chased away with harsh words and sometimes even sworn at. This is really not the way to treat hungry and poor people - it is utterly shameful to treat these people in this way, especially as the “charity” receives vast quantities of donated perishable and non-perishable foods. It is very obvious that the only ones to benefit from the donations are the manager and his salaried staff. What kind of people steal food from the poor in the name of “charity”? These “charities”, run by corrupt managers, are making it bad for the charities that really do care about and assist the poor. These managers should be fired and replaced with people who understand the word “charity”, if not, the charity should be shut down! Companies, schools and individuals should be made aware, that in many cases, their donations are not reaching the poor and hungry people at all! Thank you.
