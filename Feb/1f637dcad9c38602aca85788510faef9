She told hundreds of DA election volunteers during the party’s launch of its election campaign video in Durban on Sunday that the party did not subscribe to xenophobia. She said the DA’s call for the borders to be secured had been confused with being against foreigners, especially those from African countries. “We also want to provide safe space for asylum seekers who are running away from countries where they are being terrorised. We want to say to them: South Africa is the safe haven for anyone,” she said. The party’s campaign video shows DA leaders including Mmusi Maimane and Zwakele Mncwango interacting with people who expressed dissatisfaction with the government’s performance. Van Damme said borders were out of control because the Department of Home Affairs was riddled with corruption. “We need to know how many people are in the country so that services can be provided according to the number of people that are in the country,” said Van Damme.
