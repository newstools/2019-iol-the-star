Johannesburg - One of the men arrested on Thursday night following a robbery that led to a shootout with the police is a convicted murderer who had been out on parole since in 2015. Zakhele Hadebe Majola, 48, was one of the four men who had allegedly robbed a hair salon in Bramley. Police gave a chase, a shootout ensued and one of the alleged robbers was killed. One got away and Majola and the other man were arrested. It was while he was being processed that it was found that Majola had in fact been at odds with the law since the 90s. In 1996 when he was 25 years old, Majola was convicted for a murder committed in Tembisa. He was sentenced to 46 years but released on parole in 2015 after serving only 19 years. It was not long after he clashed with the law again as in 2017 he was arrested for being in possession of an unlicensed firearm. He was granted R10 000 bail. However, while still on bail, he was arrested on Thursday night for armed robbery. This was after four men driving a Hyundai were alleged to have robbed a hair salon at Bramley. Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said as they fled, the men hijacked a VW Polo, then a BMW at Edenvale before driving towards Tembisa. The Polo and BMW were found abandoned in Norkem Park. "The four suspects, who were driving a Hyundai, came across a roadblock in Thembisa where a shootout ensued. One of the suspects was shot and killed and two others arrested. A fourth suspect managed to escape. Stolen cellphones, perfumes, a laptop, and two unlicensed firearms were seized and their gateway vehicle impounded," Dlamini said. Majola and his co-accused appeared at the Alexandra Magistrate's Court on Monday for armed robbery. He will be back in court for the 2017 possession of an unlicensed firearm charge on March 1.
