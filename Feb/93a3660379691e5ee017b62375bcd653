The Star had earlier reported that six awaiting prisoners had escaped. However, police spokesperson confirmed that it was in fact two who had  escaped. Constable Phumi Kraai said the two men, aged 27 and 29 years old, escaped just before they could be scanned and taken to the holding cells. "They attacked two police officers. One was stabbed on the upper arm and the other was ruffled. They two them  jumped out the window of the court and escaped to the  nearby post office. They are still at large and the police are still investigating."     #BreakingNews @TheStar_news @IOL @ReporterStar South Gauteng High Court on lockdown after 6 prisoners allegedly escaped this morning. pic.twitter.com/sHvX8wOqxe Kraai said although the men were to appear in court for murder, the killings had been committed separately in different areas.
