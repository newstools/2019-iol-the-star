The Men's Conference has proven that South Africans are still able to laugh in spite of the country going through load shedding and the state capture inquiry, to name but a few of the most pressing issues. Plans for the imaginary conference started a few weeks ago when men who supposedly did not want to lavish gifts on their wives and girlfriends on Valentine's Day came up with the idea to go AWOL from February 14 to the 15th. When the day finally arrived, it sparked hilarious memes on Twitter. From videos to pictures, South Africans seemed to have forgotten their differences in the interest of having some good, clean fun. DON'T BE LATE FOR THE CONFERENCE.😂🔥😂🔥😂🔥😂🔥😂🔥#mzansi #mahlae #MensConference#MensValentinesConference #MensConference2019 #mensconference19 #ValentinesDay pic.twitter.com/CkPCET6K9h According to them, they would be away on a Men's Conference. One thing though, women would not be allowed and the venue, they also said, would be undisclosed.
