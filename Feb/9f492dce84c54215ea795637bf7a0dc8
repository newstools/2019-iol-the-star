"The passing is a significant loss to the cultural heritage of South Africa and the continent.

President Ramaphosa offered his condolences to Mama Dorothy’s family and friends in South Africa and elsewhere.     I just heard of the terrible news of the passing of our African Jazz Icon Mama Dorothy Masuka. May your soul rest in song. Mama thank you for the inspiration. May your family find solice in the Almighty. We appreciate the contribution to our beloved Azania ✊🏿#RIPDorothyMasuka pic.twitter.com/ELtywxa45X Masuka was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga in Silver for excellent achievement in and contribution to music composition and performance. She started out as a performer at the age of 16 and developed into an accomplished songwriter and internationally acclaimed artist in the course of half a century. Her music challenged the apartheid state and she was outspoken offstage on a range of social and political issues in South Africa and around the continent. Paying tribute to the late artist, Ramaphosa said: “Another golden voice in the chorus line of our nation has been silenced with the passing of Mama Dorothy Masuka. “She belonged to a generation of artists who transcended boundaries in art and politics long before we coined the concept of globalisation. “Mama Dorothy was part of a cohort of performers – notably women - who were driven by wanting to create a better society and a better world. “Mama Dorothy’s voice and poetry took us on stirring, uplifting and agitating journeys through the human experience. “While the spotlight of stages all around the world were trained in her, she shone a light on the joys and struggles of life across the lines of race, class and nationality that were so starkly entrenched in the world and era in which she first emerged as an artistic force.” Ramaphosa called on South Africans to celebrate Mama Dorothy’s life and legacy and to emulate the resilience with which she conducted her life and career into the advanced years of her life. Masuka was an active member of the Living Legends Trust started by the Department of Arts and Culture in 2015. Family spokesperson Fortune Hute said Mama D, as she was affectionately known, passed away in the comfort of her home in Joburg South surrounded by family. "She was struggling with hypertension since July last year." The family will release details of a memorial service and funeral arrangements in the week.
