The 29-year-old, who works at the Department of Water and Sanitation in Gauteng, has been selected to participate in an information-sharing programme in that country facilitated by the government of the Netherlands. She and other participants will share their expertise on drinking water and waste water. Mahlayeye’s journey to becoming a scientist started when she applied for a bursary advertised in a local newspaper by a mining company. “I then lost funding from the bursary after I failed some of my modules (while studying for) my undergraduate qualification, but that didn’t stop me from pursuing my dream to be a scientist,” she said. Raised by a single parent in a family of five children, Mahlayeye had to sell sweets and muffins at high school to make ends meet. “I learned how to be independent at a young age, and never let any situation bring me down. I always believed that there is a solution to every problem.” She joined the department four years ago as a graduate trainee, and plans to study for a PhD at the University of Twente, in Enschede, 160km east of the capital, Amsterdam. The information-sharing programme, to take place from March 17-27, would enable her to engage with professionals from other countries, and find ways to improve the water sector of South Africa and those of other developing countries. “I also believe I can bring back effective ways of dealing with the drought crisis faced by South Africa.”
