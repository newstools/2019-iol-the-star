Cape Town - Power utility Eskom has announced that it will implement Stage 3 rotational load shedding from 8:00 to 23:00 on Tuesday. "Despite the generating units returning to service as planned, the emergency reserves (diesel and water) are still very low," said Eskom in a statement. Stage 3 calls for 3000MW to be rotationally load shed across the country. South Africans were angered and surprised when Stage 2 load sheddingÂ was moved to Stage 4 load shedding on Monday. The power utility calls on residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly and to switch off geysers and non-essential lighting and electrical appliances. The Eskom board vowed it would urgently embark on an in-depth audit of its systems. The board had a meeting with its executive management and the Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. * Get the latest load shedding schedule here. ** For the latest #Loadshedding news click here. *** Receive IOL's top stories via WhatsApp by sending your name to 0745573535.
